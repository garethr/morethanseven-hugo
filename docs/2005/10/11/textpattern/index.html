    <p>
In something of a shock I’ve just ported the site (well some of it so far) to <a href="http://www.textpattern.com">Textpattern</a>. I’d alluded that I was looking to do something similar (I mentioned a crazy Ruby fueled idea, but strayed away after having a run in with fastcgi) a little time ago but have finally gotten around to it.

</p>
<p>
The reasons where many fold, but mainly came down to wanting to do other things that write content management applications. I know I can do it, and it’s certainly not a solved problem, but it’s not as much a part of my job any more – every few months I was wanting to go back and rewrite something fundamental (or everything) and it was getting in the way of me doing other, hopefully more interesting and useful things – like <a href="http://newcastlenewmedia.org">Newcastle New Media</a> , <a href="http://morethanseven.net/fluidflash">Fluid Flash</a> or playing with whatever buzz word is in this week (definately <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web2.0">Web 2.0</a>).

</p>
<p>
So after what was quite a brief look around I settled on Textpattern mainly for it’s positioning. It is a blogging ap, but has lots of other features that allow content management of other elements – hopefully useful for side projects and the like. It’s PHP and MySQL so I can rip it to pieces if I want. It’s mature, stable, feature rich and does, with plugins, everything I probably need – the big question will be if it does them in a way I like, so far it’s thumbs up. Oh and <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk">John Hick’s</a> has written a number of really good articles on textpattern, including a <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/textpattern-migration">migration piece</a> which gave me some pointers.

</p>
<p>
I’ve ported recent posts and comments, I’ll move the rest on an as time permits basis but, after some mod\_rewriting mad skills I’ve kept the <a href="http://morethanseven.net/weblog/">old site</a> fully functional (no link rot – yeah).

</p>
<p>
All in all it probably took me 4 hours, in a couple of sessions, to get all the styles into textpattern, set up a few plug-ins (del.icio.us links, live previews – whoo), port the latest content and move from my development box to here. A pretty good testament to the ease of use of textpattern. If I had not had the original design or content I would have been up and running in minutes – the installation process is smooth as a new cuddly toy.

</p>
<p>
Their are a couple of changes that hopefully only the anal will even see. I’ll try and resurect some of them, probably in a more satisfying manner that before.

</p>
<p>
For the moment I’ll keep the existing rss feed up to date but only for a little while, the new textpattern feeds can be accessed from the navigation menu, and now include an atom feed as well (basically because I can).

</p>
<p>
In conclusion, anyone looking to move, or start, a blog style site with other ambitions then textpattern could be what your looking for – although some PHP skills wouldn’t go a miss.

</p>
<p>
Anyway, here’s to a more organised life. Anything fundamentally wrong let me know!
