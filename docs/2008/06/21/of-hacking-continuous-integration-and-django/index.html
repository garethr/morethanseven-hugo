<p>I&rsquo;ve not written anything here for a good few weeks, my tweeting has slowed down some and I&rsquo;m behind on my feed reading. I&rsquo;m going to blame the new job and the daily commute from Cambridge to London I think. I&rsquo;ve definitely not been any less busy that usual:</p>

<h3 id="hacking">Hacking</h3>

<p>We had an internal hackday on Thursday and Friday last week where lots of us over at GCap/Global downed tools and build cools stuff for a couple of days. This is exactly the sort of reason I took the job in London - for the opportunity to build interesting things quickly with other smart people. I got to play around with an event driven, music orientated, API hack and a more useful but less sexy documentation hack. Yes, I said documentation hack. I might be able to release the latter all being well but I need to finish it off first and kick the tyres on some internal projects</p>

<h3 id="django">Django</h3>

<p>As a development team we&rsquo;re using <a href="http://djangoproject.com/">Django</a> for everything which is proving to be huge fun. It&rsquo;s a decent size project and we&rsquo;re pushing Django (and in particular new-forms admin) in interesting ways. Having worked previously with PHP, ASP.NET and Rails I&rsquo;m loving lots of bits of Django. I mentioned the <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/why-the-webstandards-world-appears-to-be-choosing-django/">template system</a> before but their are lots of other things to appreciate. Some of this just comes from working with people like <a href="http://simonwillison.com">Simon</a> and <a href="http://www.siudesign.co.uk/">Rob</a> who know Django pretty well. Some of it just from being able to write Python every day.</p>

<h3 id="continuous-integration">Continuous Integration</h3>

<p>When not working on Django, or writing HTML, CSS or Javascipt (now mainly using <a href="http://jquery.com">JQuery</a>), I&rsquo;ve been busy pushing the benefits of Continuous Integration. As someone who is actually pretty bad at writing unit tests I like the process of working with <a href="http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/">Cruise Control</a> as a gatekeeper. I also like automation in general so have been busy with Ant scripts and some Twill scripts as well for more functional testing. Django&rsquo;s test suite is pretty nifty and easy to use. <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/testing/">The official documentation</a> is a pretty good starting point but I&rsquo;m still on the lookout for some more in depth best practices articles.</p>

<p>So, between writing lots of code I&rsquo;ve had less time to write words other than internal documentation. I&rsquo;m finding the change pretty refreshing at the moment but want to keep up with writing every now and again. Who knows how that will work out? I have a feeling that I might blog more geeky code related stuff but time will see how that plays out.</p>
