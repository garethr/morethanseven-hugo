I love this idea. It has a nice warm fuzzy feeling about it. <a href="http://www.molly.com/2006/06/27/web-professionals-code-of-ethics/">Molly was musing</a> about a code of ethics for <a href="http://www.molly.com/2005/11/14/web-standards-and-the-new-professionalism/">professional</a> web developers. Talk went on at <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2006">@media</a> about certification and education and the like, and the general concensus was pretty negative, for good reason in my opinion.

</p>
<p>
However, a code of ethics, more a stamement of intent from professional to professional, strikes me as a really good idea. It’s easy to forget that it can be difficult when learning (and aren’t we always learning in this job?) to really get down to best practice. It can be difficult to just do it at times, never mind do it <em>properly</em> what ever that means.

</p>
<p>
After reading on the comments I was feeling pretty good, and a few from the bottom I was thinking, I’ll set up a wiki, as suggested. Well, <a href="http://www.meriwilliams.com">Meri</a> got their first so good job Meri, it keeps it in Newcastle any how. <a href="http://www.meriwilliams.com/ethics/index.php?title=Main_Page">Head over there now</a>, it’s fairly light on content at the moment but I guess that is the point of this point.

</p>
<p>
What do other people think of this anyhow? Now I need to find some time. Or rather more time. I love being all enthusiastic, if only I found the time! I’m going to have to cut down on sleep, and I so like sleep.
