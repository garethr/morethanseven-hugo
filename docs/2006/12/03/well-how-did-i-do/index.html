Well, the year is ever so nearly over. Again. I’m sure their will be a good few round ups, I’ll probably even partake <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/obligatory-next-year-post">again</a>, but thought I’d start off with a quick look at how I got on with my <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/more-to-comestatement-of-intent">list of stuff to do</a>.

</p>
<p>
I did the conference thing again and I’m sure I will be back this coming year. <a href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia2006/">`media</a>, <a href="http://www.futureofwebapps.com/">Future of Web Apps</a> and <a href="http://2006.dconstruct.org/">dConstruct</a> all look like going from strength to strength. And all being different enought to be worth going along. And I stayed awake throughout the Ajax workshops and I&#8217;m pretty sure I got to everything `media had to offer. So that’s three ticked off.

</p>
<p>
On the article publishing thang. Well, I’m know writing for <a href="http://www.thinkvitamin.com/">Vitamin</a> – doing book reviews as often as I can do, two so far on <a href="http://www.thinkvitamin.com/reviews/coding/communicating-design-by-dan-brown/">Communicating Design</a> and <a href="http://www.thinkvitamin.com/reviews/dev/using-microformats-by-brian-suda/">Using Microformats</a> and more to come. Hopefully more to come on that front too. Another tick I reckon.

</p>
<p>
The next two, related to building and releasing stuff (specifically Rails and the feed syndicator) I sort of passed on. I actually have some things in the works but I’m not likely to get their this year. The reason was probably my flirtation with all sorts of other things – in particular Python. Releasing bits of code is something I’m going to do more of. Watch this space. Two crosses.

</p>
<p>
Locally I messed up the domain name but settled on the nicer <a href="http://refreshnewcastle.org">refreshnewcastle.org</a> and with a little help from <a href="http://thewatchmakerproject.com/">Matthew <del>Patterson</del> Pennell</a> have a nice new site. Next year I want to do more than just web site related bits an pieces. Maybe half a tick?

</p>
<p>
Now the “something vague” idea. Well, <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/teaching">teaching web design</a> at Newcastle College definately counts here I think. I didn’t see this coming and hopefully I’m doing a good job so far.

</p>
<p>
Ok, so not bad going, but I could do better. And looking back over a list I made a year ago is quite interesting. I guess I’m posting this early to encourage anyone reading it to post a list of things they want to do next year. Anyone got any ideas?
