      </h1>
      <span class="post-date">Jun 26, 2017 &middot; 5 minute read
      </span>
      
      

<p>I&rsquo;ve been playing around building a few Kubernetes developer tools at
the moment and a few of those led me to the question; how do I validate
this Kubernetes resource definition? This simple question led me through
a bunch of GitHub issues without resolution, conversations with folks
who wanted something similar, the OpenAPI specification and finally to
what I hope is a nice resolution.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re just after the schemas and don&rsquo;t care for the details just
head on over to the following GitHub repositories.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/garethr/kubernetes-json-schema">garethr/kubernetes-json-schema</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/garethr/openshift-json-schema">garethr/openshift-json-schema</a></li>
</ul>

<p>OpenShift gets a separate repository as it has an independent version
scheme and adds a number of additional types into the mix.</p>

<h2 id="but-why">But why?</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth asking the question <em>why</em> before delving too far into the
how. Let&rsquo;s go back to the problem; I have a bunch of Kubernetes resource
definitions, lets say in YAML, and I want to know if they are valid?</p>

<p>Now you might be thinking I could just run them with <code>kubectl</code>? This
raises a few issues which I don&rsquo;t care for in a developer tool:</p>

<ul>
<li>It requires <code>kubectl</code> to be installed and configured</li>
<li>It requires <code>kubectl</code> to be pointed at a working Kubernetes cluster</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are a few knock-on effects of the above issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>Running what should be a simple validate step in a CI system now
requires a Kubernetes cluster</li>
<li>Why do I have to shell out to something and parse it&rsquo;s output to validate
a document, for instance if I&rsquo;m doing it in the context of a unit test?</li>
<li>If I want to validate the definition against multiple versions of
Kubernetes I need multiple Kubernetes clusters</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully at this point it&rsquo;s clear why the above doesn&rsquo;t work. I don&rsquo;t
want to have to run a boat load of Kubernetes infrastructure to validate
the structure of a text file. Why can&rsquo;t I just have a schema in a
standard format with widespread library support?</p>

<h2 id="from-openapi-to-json-schema">From OpenAPI to JSON Schema</h2>

<p>Under-the-hood Kubernetes is all about types. Pods,
ReplicationControllers, Deployments, etc. It&rsquo;s these primatives that
give Kubernetes it&rsquo;s power and shape. These are described in the
Kubernetes source code and are used to generate an OpenAPI description of
the Kubernetes HTTP API. I&rsquo;ve been spelunking here before with some work on
<a href="https://github.com/garethr/garethr-kubernetes">generating Puppet types from this same specification</a>.</p>

<p>The latest version of OpenAPI in fact already contains the type
information we seek, encoded in a superset of <a href="http://json-schema.org">JSON
Schema</a> in the <code>definitions</code> key. This is
used by the various tools which generate clients from that definition.
For instance the official python client doesn&rsquo;t know about these types
directly, it all comes from the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/client-python/blob/master/scripts/update-client.sh">OpenAPI description of the
API</a>. But how
do we use those <code>definitions</code> separately for our own nefarious
validation purposes? Here&rsquo;s a quick sample of what we see in the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/master/api/openapi-spec/swagger.json">50,000
line-long OpenAPI definition file</a></p>

<p>The discussion around wanting JSON Schemas for Kubernetes types has
cropped up in a few places before, there are some useful comments on <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/14987">this
issue</a> for
instance. I didn&rsquo;t find a comprehensive solution however, so set out on
a journey to build one.</p>

<h2 id="openapi2jsonschema">OpenAPI2JsonSchema</h2>

<p>The tooling I&rsquo;ve build for this purpose is called
<a href="https://github.com/garethr/openapi2jsonschema">openapi2jsonschema</a>.
It&rsquo;s not Kubernetes specific and should work with other OpenAPI
specificied APIs too, although as yet I&rsquo;ve done only a little testing of
that. Usage of <code>openapi2jsonschema</code> is fairly straightforward, just
point it at the URL for an OpenAPI definition and watch it generate a
whole bunch of files.</p>

<pre><code>openapi2jsonschema https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/master/api/openapi-spec/swagger.json
</code></pre>

<p><code>openapi2jsonschema</code> can generate different flavours of output, useful
for slightly different purposes. You probably only need to care about
this if you&rsquo;re generating you&rsquo;re own schemas or you want to work
completely offline.</p>

<ul>
<li>default - URL referenced based on the specified GitHub repository</li>
<li>standalone - de-referenced schemas, more useful as standalone documents</li>
<li>local - relative references, useful to avoid the network dependency</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/garethr/kubernetes-json-schema/blob/master/build.sh">build script</a>
for the Kubernetes schemas is a simple way of seeing this in practice.</p>

<h2 id="published-schemas">Published Schemas</h2>

<p>Using the above tooling I&rsquo;m publishing Schemas for Kubernetes, and for
OpenShift, which can be used directly from GitHub.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/garethr/kubernetes-json-schema">garethr/kubernetes-json-schema</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/garethr/openshift-json-schema">garethr/openshift-json-schema</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As an example of what these look like, here are the links to the latest <code>deployment</code> schemas for
1.6.1:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/garethr/kubernetes-json-schema/tree/master/v1.6.1/deployment.json">v1.6.1/deployment.json</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/garethr/kubernetes-json-schema/tree/master/v1.6.1-standalone/deployment.json">v1.6.1-standalone/deployment.json</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/garethr/kubernetes-json-schema/tree/master/v1.6.1-local/deployment.json">v1.6.1-local/deployment.json</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a-simple-example">A simple example</h2>

<p>There are lots of use cases for these schemas, although they are primarily
useful as a low-level part of other developer workflow tools. But at a most
basic level you can validate a Kubernetes config file.</p>

<p>Here is a quick example using the Python <a href="https://github.com/Julian/jsonschema">jsonschema
client</a> and an invalid deployment
file:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span>$ jsonschema -F <span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;{error.message}&quot;</span> -i hello-nginx.json
1.5.1-standalone/deployment.json
u<span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&#39;template&#39;</span> is a required property
</pre></div>

<h2 id="what-to-do-with-all-those-schema">What to do with all those schema?</h2>

<p>As noted these schemas have lots of potential uses for development
tools. Here are a few ideas, some of which I&rsquo;ve already been hacking on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Demonstrating using with the more common YAML serialisation</li>
<li>Testing tools to show your Kubernetes configuration files are valid,
and against which versions of Kubernetes</li>
<li>Migration tools to check your config files are still valid against
master or beta releases</li>
<li>Integration with code editors, for instance via something like <a href="http://schemastore.org/json/">Schema
Store</a></li>
<li>Validation of Kubernetes configs generated by higher-level tools, like
Helm, Ksonnet or Puppet</li>
<li>Visual tools for crafting Kubernetes configurations</li>
<li>Tools to show changes between Kubernetes versions</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do use these schemas for anything please let me know, and I&rsquo;ll
try and keep them updated with releases of Kubernetes and OpenShift. I
plan on polishing the <code>openapi2jsonschema</code> tool when I get some time,
and I&rsquo;d love to know if anyone uses that with other OpenAPI compatible
APIs. And if all you want to do is validate your Kubernetes
configuration and don&rsquo;t care too much about what&rsquo;s happening under the
hood then stick around for the next blog post.</p>

      </h1>
      <span class="post-date">May 29, 2017 &middot; 5 minute read
      </span>
      
      

<p>Everyone has little scripts that want running on some schedule. I&rsquo;ve
seen entire organisations basically running on cron jobs. But for all
the simplicity of cron it has a few issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s a per-host solution, in a world where hosts might be short-lived
or unavailable for some other reason</li>
<li>It requires a fully configured and secured machine to run on, which
comes with direct and indirect costs</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a variety of <em>distributed cron</em> solutions around, but each
adds complexity for what might be a throw-away script. In my view this
is the perfect usecase for trying out AWS Lambda, or other Serverless
platforms. With a Serverless platform the above two issues go away from
the point-of-view of the user, they are below the level of abstraction
of the provided service. Lets see a quick example of doing this.</p>

<h2 id="apex-and-lambda">Apex and Lambda</h2>

<p>There are a number of frameworks and tools for helping deploy Serverless
functions for different platforms. I&rsquo;m going to use <a href="http://apex.run/">Apex</a>
because I&rsquo;ve found it provides just enough of a user interface without
getting in the way of writing a function.</p>

<p>Apex supports a wide range of different languages, and has <a href="https://github.com/apex/apex/tree/master/_examples">lots of
examples</a> which
makes getting started relatively easy. Installation is
<a href="http://apex.run/#installation">straightforward</a> too.</p>

<h2 id="a-sample-function">A sample function</h2>

<p>The function isn&rsquo;t really relevant to this post, but I&rsquo;ll include one
for completeness. You can write functions in officially supported
languages (like Javascript or Python) or pick one of the languages
supported via a shim in Apex. I&rsquo;ve been writing Serverless functions in
Go and Clojure recently, but I prefer Clojure so lets use that for now.</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span>(<span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">ns </span><span style="color: #336699">net.morethanseven.hello</span>

  [<span style="color: #336699">this</span> <span style="color: #336699">input-stream</span> <span style="color: #336699">output-stream</span> <span style="color: #336699">context</span>]
  (<span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">let </span>[<span style="color: #336699">handle</span> (<span style="color: #0066bb; font-weight: bold">io/writer</span> <span style="color: #336699">output-stream</span>)]
    (<span style="color: #0066bb; font-weight: bold">.write</span> <span style="color: #336699">handle</span> (<span style="color: #003388">str </span><span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;hello&quot;</span> <span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;world&quot;</span>))
    (<span style="color: #0066bb; font-weight: bold">.flush</span> <span style="color: #336699">handle</span>)))
</pre></div>

<p>This would be saved at
<code>functions/hello/src/net/morethanseven/hello.clj</code>, and the Apex
<code>project.json</code> file should point at the function above:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span>{
  <span style="color: #bb0066; font-weight: bold">&quot;runtime&quot;</span>: <span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;clojure&quot;</span>,
  <span style="color: #bb0066; font-weight: bold">&quot;handler&quot;</span>: <span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;net.morethanseven.hello::handleRequest&quot;</span>
}
</pre></div>

<p>You would also need a small configuration file at <code>functions/hello/project.clj</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span>(<span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">defproject </span><span style="color: #336699">net.morethanseven</span> <span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;0.1.0-SNAPSHOT&quot;</span>

</pre></div>

<p>The above is really just showing an example of how little code a
function might contain, the specifics are relevant only if you&rsquo;re
intersted in Clojure. But imagine the same sort of thing for your
language of choice.</p>

<h1 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</h1>

<p>The interesting part (hopefully) of this blog post is the observation
that using AWS Lambda doesn&rsquo;t mean you don&rsquo;t need any infrastructure or
configuration. The good news is that, for the periodic job/cron usecase
this infrastructure is fairly standard between jobs.</p>

<p>Apex has <a href="http://apex.run/#managing-infrastructure">useful integration with Terraform</a>
to help manage any required infrastructure too. We can run the following
two commands to provision and then manage our infrastructure.</p>

<pre><code>apex infra init
apex infra deploy
</code></pre>

<p>Doing so requires us to write a little Terraform code. First we need
some variables, we&rsquo;ll invclude this in <code>infrastructure/variables.tf</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span><span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">variable</span> <span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;aws_region&quot;</span> {
<span style="color: #336699">  description</span> = <span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;AWS Region Lambda function is deployed to&quot;</span>
}

<span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">variable</span> <span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;apex_environment&quot;</span> {
<span style="color: #336699">  description</span> = <span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;Apex configured environment. Auto provided by &#39;apex infra&#39;&quot;</span>
}

<span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">variable</span> <span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;apex_function_role&quot;</span> {
<span style="color: #336699">  description</span> = <span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;Provisioned Lambda Role ARN via Apex. Auto provided by &#39;apex infra&#39;&quot;</span>
}

<span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">variable</span> <span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;apex_function_hub&quot;</span> {
<span style="color: #336699">  description</span> = <span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;Provisioned function &#39;hub&#39; ARN information. Auto provided by &#39;apex infra&#39;&quot;</span>
}

<span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">variable</span> <span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;apex_function_hub_name&quot;</span> {
<span style="color: #336699">  description</span> = <span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;Provisioned function &#39;hub&#39; name information. Auto provided by &#39;apex infra&#39;&quot;</span>
}
</pre></div>

<p>Here we&rsquo;re running the job every 5 minutes, but it should be relatively
easy to see how you can change that frequency. See the Terraform and AWS
Lambda documentation for all the possible options.</p>

<h2 id="on-complexity-user-interface-and-abstractions">On complexity, user interface and abstractions</h2>

<p>The above is undoutedly powerful, and nicely solves the described
probles with using Cron. However it&rsquo;s not all plain sailing I feel
with Serverless as a Cron replacement.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about complexity. If I can make the assumptions that:</p>

<ul>
<li>The underlying host I was going to run my cron job on host is well managed,
potentially by another team in my organisation</li>
<li>Hosts don&rsquo;t suffer downtime, or if they do it&rsquo;s occasional and they
are brough back up quickly</li>
</ul>

<p>Then I can just use cron. And the interface to cron looks something more
like:</p>

<pre><code>*/5 * * * * /home/garethr/run.sh
</code></pre>

<p>I still had to write my function (the Clojure code above) but I
collapsed the configuration of three distinct AWS resources and the use of a
new tool (Terraform) into a one-line crontab entry. You might have
provisioned that cron job using Puppet or Chef which adds a few lines
and a new tool, which sits somewhere between hand editing and the above
example.</p>

<p>This is really a question of user interface design and abstractions.
On one hand Serverless provides a nice high-level shared abstraction for
developers (the function). On another Serverless requires a great deal
of (virtual) infrastructure, which at the moment tends not to be abstracted
from the end-user. In the simple case above I had to care about
<code>aws_cloudwatch_event_targets</code>, <code>aws_cloudwatch_event_rules</code> and
<code>aws_lambda_permissions</code>. The use of those non-abstract resources all
couples my simple cron example to a specific platform (AWS) when the
simple function could likely run on any Serverless platform that
supports the JVM.</p>

<h2 id="serverless-not-infrastructureless">Serverless, not Infrastructureless</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m purposefully nit-picking with the above example. Serverless does
provide a more straightforward cron experience, mainly because it&rsquo;s
self-contained. But the user interface even for simple examples is still
very raw in many cases. Importantly, in removing the concept of ervers,
we don&rsquo;t appear to have removed the need to configure infrastructure,
which I think is what many people thing of when they hope to be rid of
servers in the first place.</p>

<p>While reviewing 100s of proposals for upcoming conferences (Velocity EU and
PuppetConf) I tweeted <a href="https://twitter.com/garethr/status/863780750927286273">the
following</a>, which
seemed to get a few folks interest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I should write a blog post on &ldquo;conference talk submissions for
vendors/consultants&rdquo;. Rule one: own your bias</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/dparzych/status/864217466389405696">This reply</a> in
particular pushed me over the edge into actually writing this post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Would love to hear advice, been told more than once a talk was rejected
since I work for a vendor, even though my talk was not a pitch.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Writing something up felt like it might be useful to a few folks so here
goes. This is but one persons opinion, but I at least have some relevant
experience:</p>

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ve worked for a software vendor for about 3 years</li>
<li>Before that I worked for the UK Government, and before that various
SaaS companies, in-house software teams and very briefly myself</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve helped out on the programme committee or similar for a variety of
events going back a bunch of years; Velocity, PuppetConf, Lisa,
Devopsdays, QCon</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to speak at a wide range of events in lots of
different places</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the following advice is pretty general, if you&rsquo;re interested in
speaking at software conferences (at least those I&rsquo;ve seen or spoken at)
then hopefully much of this is relevant to you. But I also want to focus on
people working for a software vendor. I think that&rsquo;s particularly
relevant as more and more traditional vendors court the open source
community and software developers inparticular, and roles like
<em>developer evangelist</em> see lots of people moving from more practioner
roles to work vendor-side.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-write-a-good-proposal">Learn to write a good proposal</h2>

<p>My main experience with speaking at conferences, or helping currate
content, is via a call-for-proposals. The conference will have some
sort of theme or topic, set a date, and see what content is submitted.
Their are a variety of oft-made points here about sponsoring to get a
talk slot, or submitting early, or approaching the organisers, but in my
experience the best bet is to write a really good proposal around a good
idea. That&rsquo;s obviously easier said that done, but it&rsquo;s not as hard as
you may think.</p>

<ul>
<li>Introduce the problem you&rsquo;re talking about, but don&rsquo;t make
this the whole proposal.</li>
<li>State in the proposal what you&rsquo;re going to talk about. Be specific.
Don&rsquo;t say &ldquo;an open source tool&rdquo; when you mean a specific tool which
has a name. Don&rsquo;t hide the details of the talk because you intend to
reveal them when presenting.</li>
<li>Include explicitly what the audience will do or be able to do
differently after seeing the talk. Go so far as to say <em>&ldquo;after this
talk attendee will&hellip;&rdquo;</em></li>
<li>Novely really helps, as long as the topic is interesting and relevant.
Given 100 proposals about deploying your web application with Docker,
the one that says &ldquo;and we do this for the International Space Station&rdquo;
is getting picked.</li>
<li>If you know this is going to be a popular topic for other proposals
then you also need to confince the CFP committee why you&rsquo;re the best
person to present it.</li>
<li>Liberally use bullet points. This might be a personal thing but if I&rsquo;m
reading 200+ proposals making it quick to read helps get your point
across.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unless you write a good proposal around an interesting idea you probably
won&rsquo;t be accepted whether you&rsquo;re a software vendor or not. Try get
feedback on your proposals, especially from folks who have previously
spoken at the event you&rsquo;re hoping to present at.</p>

<h2 id="appreciate-you-re-selling-something">Appreciate you&rsquo;re selling something</h2>

<p>If you work for a software vendor your job is to sell software. Not
everyone likes that idea, but I think at least for the purposes of this
blog post it stands true. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re an evangelist
reporting into Marketing, or a software developer in Engineering or
anything else - you stand to gain directly or indirectly from people
purchasing your product. From the point of view of a conference you are
thoroughly compromised when it comes to talking about your product
directly. This can be disheartening as you likely work at the vendor
and want to talk at the conference because you&rsquo;re genuinely interested,
even evangelical, about the product. You need to own that bias - there
really is no way around it.</p>

<p>If you work for a vendor, and the CFP committee even thinks the proposal
is about that product, you&rsquo;ll probably not be given the benefit of
doubt.</p>

<h2 id="and-the-answers-is">And the answers is&hellip;</h2>

<p>Probably the worst example of vendor talks that do sometimes get
accepted go something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Introduce a problem people can relate to</li>
<li>Show some (probably open source) options for solving, focusing on the
large integration cost of tying them together</li>
<li>Conclude with the answer being the vendors all-in-one product</li>
</ul>

<p>I think for expo events or for sponsored slots this approach is totally
valid, but for a CFP it bugs me:</p>

<ul>
<li>The proposal probably didn&rsquo;t explain that the the answer was the
commercial product sold by the vendor</li>
<li>The talk is unlikely to cover like-for-like competition, for instance
it&rsquo;s probably not going to spend much time referring to direct
commercial competitors</li>
<li>As noted above, the presented is thoroughly biased, which doesn&rsquo;t make
for a great conference talk</li>
</ul>

<p>Please don&rsquo;t do this. It&rsquo;s a easy trap to fall into, mainly because you
hopefully genuinely believe in the product you&rsquo;re talking about and the
problem you&rsquo;re solving. If you really want talks like this try and
encourage your customers to give then - a real-world story version of
this is much more interesting.</p>

<h2 id="talk-about-the-expertise-rather-than-the-product">Talk about the expertise rather than the product</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s not all doom for those working for software vendors and wanting to
talk at conferences. The reality is that while you&rsquo;re working on a
discrete product you&rsquo;re also likely spending a lot of time thinking about
a specific domain. I spent a bunch of years using Puppet as a product,
but I&rsquo;ve spent more time while working at Puppet thinking about the
nature of configuration, and about wildly heterogenuous systems. When I
worked for the Government I interacted with a handful of departments and
projects. At Puppet I&rsquo;ve spoken with 100s of customers, and read trip
reports on meetings with others. Working for a vendor gives you a
different view of what&rsquo;s going on, especially if you talk to people from
other departments.</p>

<p>In my experience, some of the best talks from those working for software
vendors can be quite meta, theoretical or future facing. You have the
dual benefit of working in a singular domain (so you can do deep) and
hopefully having access to lots customers (so you can go broad).</p>

<h2 id="talks-as-a-product-design-tool">Talks as a product design tool</h2>

<p>As someone working for a vendor, a big part of my job is designing and
building new features or new products. I&rsquo;ve regularly found giving talks
(including the time taken to think about the topic and put together the
demos and slides) to be a great design tool. Assuming you&rsquo;re already
doing research like this, even in the background, pitching a talk on the
subject has a few advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>It starts you writing for a public audience early in the design
process</li>
<li>The talk being accepted, and the feedback from the talk, provide early
input into the design process</li>
<li>The talk (or published slides) can encourage people thinking about
similar things to get in touch</li>
</ul>

<p>You can see this if you flick through talks I&rsquo;ve given over the past few
years. For instance <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/garethr/whats-inside-that-container">What&rsquo;s inside that
container?</a>
and more recently <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/garethr/security-and-the-self-contained-unit-of-software">Security and the self-contained unit of software</a>
provide some of the conceptual underpinnings for
<a href="https://lumogon.com/">Lumogon</a>. And <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/garethr/the-dockerfile-explosion-and-the-need-for-higher-level-tools">The Dockerfile explosion - and the need for higher-level tools</a>
talk I gave at DockerCon led to the work on <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-image_build">Puppet Image
Build</a>.</p>

<p>These talks all stand alone as (hopefully) useful and interesting
presentations, but also serve a parallel internal purpose which
importantly doesn&rsquo;t excert the same bias on the content.</p>

<h2 id="some-good-examples">Some good examples</h2>

<p>The above is hopefully useful theory, but I appreciate some people
prefer examples. The following include a bunch of talks I&rsquo;ve given at
various conference, with a bit of a rationale. I&rsquo;ve also picked out a
few examples of talks by other folks I respect that work at software
vendors and generally give excellent talks.</p>

<p>A great topic for most vendors to talk about at suitable conferences is
how they approach building software. I spoke about <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/garethr/in-praise-of-slow-continuous-delivery">In praise of slow
(Continuous
Delivery)</a>
at Pipeline conference recently, about how Puppet (and other vendors)
approach techniques like feature flags, continuous delivery and
versioning but for packaged software. That had novelty, as well as being
relevant to anyone involved with an open source project.</p>

<p>Probably my favourite talk I&rsquo;ve given in the last year,
<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/garethr/the-two-sides-to-google-infrastructure-for-everyone-else">The Two Sides to Google Infrastructure for Everyone Else</a>
looks at SRE, and infrastructure from two different vantage points.
This talk came directly from spending time with the container folks on
one hand, and far more traditional IT customers on the other, and
wondering if they meet in the middle.</p>

<p>Charity Majors is the CEO at Honeycomb and likes databases a lot more
than I do. The talk <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/charity/maslows-hierarchy-of-database-needs">Maslows Hierachy of Database Needs</a>
is just solid technical content from an expert on the subject. Closer to
the Honeycomb product is this talk
<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/charity/gluecon-2017-observability-and-the-glorious-future">Observability and the Glorious Future</a>,
but even this avoids falling into the trap described above and stays
focused on generally applicable areas to consider.</p>

<p>Jason Hand from VictorOps has given a number of talks about ChatOps,
including this one entitled <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jasonhand/chatops-infrastructure-as-conversation">Infrastructure as Conversation</a>.
Note that some of the examples use VictorOps, but the specific tool
isn&rsquo;t the point of the talk. The abstract on the last slide is also a
neat idea.</p>

<p><a href="http://bridgetkromhout.com/">Bridget Kromhout</a> works for Pivotal, the
folks behind Cloud Foundry amongst other things. But she invariably
delivers some of the best big picture operations talks around. Take a
couple of recent examples <a href="http://bridgetkromhout.com/speaking/2017/monitorama/">I Volunteer as Tribute - the Future of Oncall</a>
and <a href="http://bridgetkromhout.com/speaking/2017/agile-technical/">Ops in the Time of Serverless Containerized Webscale</a>.
Neither talk is about a specific product, instead both mix big picture
transformation topics with hard-earned ops experience.</p>

<p>As a final point, all of those examples have interesting titles, which
comes back to the first point above. Make content that people really want
to listen to first, and if you&rsquo;re a vendor own your biases.</p>

        <a href="/2017/03/29/kubernetes-configuration-without-the-yaml/">Kubernetes configuration without the YAML</a>
      </h1>
      <span class="post-date">Mar 29, 2017 &middot; 3 minute read
      </span>
      
      

<p>Tomorrow at KubeCon in Berlin I&rsquo;m running a birds-of-a-feather session to talk
about Kubernetes configuration. Specifically we&rsquo;ll be talking about whether
Kubernetes configuration benefits from a domain specific language. If you&rsquo;re
at the conference and this sounds interesting <a href="http://sched.co/9Tcc">come along</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>

<p>The fact the programme committee accepted the session proposa is hopefully a good
indication that at least some other people in the community think this is an
interesting topic to discuss. I&rsquo;ve also had a number of conversations in person
and on the internet about similar areas.</p>

<p>There are a number of other traces of concerns with using YAML as the main user
interface to Kubernetes configuration. This comment from Brian Grant of Google on the
Kubernetes Config SIG mailing list for instance:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had a few complaints that YAML is ugly, error prone, hard to read, etc.
Are there any other alternatives we might want to support?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And <a href="https://twitter.com/jbeda/status/833408476437110784">this one</a> from Joe Beda,
one of the creators of Kubernetes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I want to go on record: the amount of yaml required to do anything in k8s is a
tragedy. Something we need to solve. (Subtweeting HN comment)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This quote from the <a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2898444">Borg, Omega and Kubernetes paper in ACM Queue, Volume 14, issue 1</a>
nicely sums up my feelings:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The language to represent the data should be a simple, data-only format
such as JSON or YAML, and programmatic modification of this data should
be done in a real programming language</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This quote also points at the problem I see at the moment. The configuration and the
management of that configuration are <em>separate</em> but related concerns. Far too many
people couple these together, ultimately moving all of the management complexity
onto people. That&rsquo;s a missed opportunity in my view. The Kubernetes API is my
favourite think about the project, I&rsquo;ve waxed lyrical about it allowing for
different higher-level user interfaces for different users to all interact
on the same base platform. But treating what is basically the wire format
as a user interface is just needlessly messy.</p>

<p>But what advantages do we get using a programming language to modify the data?
For me it comes down to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoiding repetition</li>
<li>Combining external inputs</li>
<li>Building tools to enforce correctness (linting, unit testing, etc.)</li>
<li>The abililty to introduce abstractions</li>
</ul>

<p>It&rsquo;s the last part I find most compelling. Building things to allow others
to interact with a smaller domain specific abstraction is one way of scaling
expertise. The infrastructure as code space I&rsquo;ve been involved in has lots of
stories to tell around different good (and bad) ways of mixing data with code,
but the idea that data on it&rsquo;s own is enough without higher-level abstractions
doesn&rsquo;t hold up in my experience.</p>

<h2 id="what-can-i-use-instead">What can I use instead?</h2>

<p>Lukily various people at this point have build tools in this space. I&rsquo;m not sure
could or should be a single answer to the question (whether there should be a
default is a harder question to answer) but the following definitely all show
what&rsquo;s possible.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://jsonnet.org/">Jsonnet</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/anguslees/kubecfg">kubecfg</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/garethr/garethr-kubernetes">Puppet Kubernetes types</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/errordeveloper/kubeplay">Kubeplay</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/maxmanuylov/terraform-provider-kubernetes">Terraform</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/fkorotkov/k8s-kotlin-dsl">Kotlin DSL</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/doriordan/skuber">Skuber</a> (Scala DSL for Kubernetes)</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously <a href="https://puppet.com/blog/managing-kubernetes-configuration-puppet">I wrote one of these</a>
so I&rsquo;m biased but different tools work for different people and in different
contexts. For example Skuber looks nice but I mainly don&rsquo;t like Scala. And
I&rsquo;ve been using Jsonnet for Packer templates recently with success, so I&rsquo;m
very interested in kubecfg which provides a nice Kubernetes wrapper to that
tool.</p>

<p>Ultimately this is still a developing space, but compared to a year ago it is
now definitely moving. For me, I hope the default for managing Kubernetes
configuration slowly but surely switches away from just hand rolling data.
Towards what, only time and people reporting what works for them will tell.</p>

      <span class="post-date">Jan 1, 2017 &middot; 2 minute read
      </span>
      
      <p>One of the many things I did some work on while at
<a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/">GDS</a> back in 2013 was the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual">Government Service Design
Manual</a>. This was intended to be a
central resource for teams across (and outside) Government about how to
go about building, designing and running modern internet-era services.
It was a good snapshot of opinions from the people that made up GDS on a
wide range of different topics. Especially for the people who spent time
in the field with other departments, having an official viewpoint published
publicly was hugely helpful.</p>

<p>Recently the Service Manual <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/12/19/introducing-the-next-stage-of-the-service-manual/">got a bit of a relaunch</a>
but unfortunately this involved deleting much of the content about
operations and running a service. Even more unfortunately the service
manual is now described as something that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>exists to help people across government build services that meet the
Digital Service Standard and prepare for service assessments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So in basic terms it&rsquo;s refocusing on helping people pass the exam rather
than being all about learning. Which is a shame. Compare that with the
original intent:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Build services so good that people prefer to use them</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, all that content is not lost. Luckily the content is <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/government-service-design-manual">archived on GitHub</a>
and was published under the terms of the <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/2/">Open Government License</a>
which allows for anyone to <em>&ldquo;copy, publish, distribute and transmit the Information&rdquo;</em>.
So I&rsquo;m choosing to republish a few of the pieces I wrote and found
useful when talking to and assisting other Government departments. These
represent an interesting snapshot from a few years ago, but I think
mainly stand the test of time, even if I&rsquo;d change a few things if I
wrote them today.</p>

<p><em>This post was originally written as part of the Government Service
Design Manual while I was working for the UK Cabinet Office. Since my
original in 2013 it was improved upon <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/government-service-design-manual/blob/master/service-manual/operations/devops.md">by several

<p>Devops is a cultural and professional movement in response to the
mistakes commonly made by large organisations. Often organisations will
have very separate units for:</p>

<ul>
<li>development</li>
<li>quality assurance</li>
<li>operations business</li>
</ul>

<p>In extreme cases these units may be:</p>

<ul>
<li>based in different locations</li>
<li>work for different organisations</li>
<li>under completely different management structures</li>
</ul>

<p>Communication costs between these units, and their individual
incentives, leads to slow delivery and a mountain of interconnected
processes.</p>

<p>This is what Devops aims to correct. It is not a methodology or
framework, but a set of principles and a willingness to break down
silos. Specifically Devops is all about:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#culture">culture</a></li>
<li><a href="#automation">automation</a></li>
<li><a href="#measurement">measurement</a></li>

<h3 id="culture">Culture</h3>

<p>Devops needs a change in attitude so shared ownership and collaboration
are the common working practices in building and managing a service.
This culture change is especially important for established
organisations.</p>

<h3 id="automation">Automation</h3>

<p>Many business processes are ready to be automated. Automation removes
manual, error-prone tasks &ndash; allowing people to concentrate on the
quality of the service. Common areas that benefit from automation are:</p>

<ul>
<li>release management (releasing software)</li>
<li>provisioning</li>
<li>configuration management</li>
<li>systems integration</li>
<li>monitoring</li>
<li>orchestration (the arrangement and maintenance of complex computer
systems)</li>
<li>testing</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="measurement">Measurement</h3>

<p>Data can be incredibly powerful for implementing change, especially when
it’s used to get people from different groups involved in the quality of
the end-to-end service delivery. Collecting information from different
teams and being able to compare it across former silos can implement
change on its own.</p>

<h3 id="sharing">Sharing</h3>

<p>People from different backgrounds (ie development and operations) often
have different, but overlapping skill sets. Sharing between groups will
spread an understanding of the different areas behind a successful
service, so encourage it. Resolving issues will then be more about
working together and not negotiating contracts.</p>

<h2 id="why-devops">Why Devops</h2>

<p>The quality of your service will be compromised if teams can&rsquo;t work
together, specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li>those who build and test software</li>
<li>those that run it in production</li>
</ul>

<p>The root cause is often functional silos; when one group owns a specific
area (say quality) it’s easy for other areas to assume that it’s no
longer their concern.</p>

<p>This attitude is toxic, especially in areas such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>quality</li>
<li>release management</li>
<li>performance</li>
</ul>

<p>High quality digital services need to be able to adapt quickly to user
needs, and this can only happen with close collaboration between
different groups.</p>

<p>Make sure the groups in your team:</p>

<ul>
<li>have a shared sense of ownership of the service</li>
<li>have a shared sense of the problem</li>
<li>develop a culture of making measurable improvements to how things work</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="good-habits">Good habits</h2>

<p>Devops isn’t a project management methodology, but use these good habits
in your organisation. While not unique to Devops, they help with
breaking down silos when used with the above principles:</p>

<ul>
<li>cross-functional teams &ndash; make sure your
teams are made up of people from different functions (this helps with
the team owning the end-to-end quality of service and makes it easier to
break down silos)</li>
<li>widely shared metrics &ndash; it’s important
for everyone to know what ‘good’ looks like so share high and low
level metrics as widely as possible as it builds understanding</li>
<li>automating repetitive tasks &ndash; use software development to automate
tasks across the service as it:

<ul>
<li>encourages a better understanding of the whole service</li>
<li>frees up smart people from doing repetitive manual tasks</li>
</ul></li>
<li>post-mortems &ndash; issues will happen so it’s critical that everyone
across different teams learns from them; running post-mortems (an
analysis session after an event) with people from different groups is a
great way of spreading knowledge</li>
<li>regular releases
&ndash; the capacity for releasing software is often limited in siloed
organisations, because the responsibilities of the different parts of
the release are often spread out across teams &ndash; getting to a point
where you can release regularly (even many times a day) requires extreme
collaboration and clever automation</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="warning-signs">Warning signs</h2>

<p>Like agile, the term Devops is often used for marketing or promotional
purposes. This leads to a few common usages, which aren’t necessarily in
keeping with what’s been said here. Watch out for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Devops tools (nearly always marketing)</li>
<li>a Devops team (in many cases this is just a new silo of skills and
knowledge)</li>
<li>Devops as a job title (you wouldn’t call someone “an agile”)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>This post was originally written as part of the Government Service
Design Manual while I was working for the UK Cabinet Office. Since my
original in 2013 it was improved upon <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/government-service-design-manual/blob/master/service-manual/operations/service-management.md">by several
others</a>
I&rsquo;m republishing it here under the terms of the <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/2/">Open Government
licence</a>.</em></p>

<p>The Digital by Default standard
says that organisations should (emphasis on <em>operate</em> added):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Put in place a sustainable multidisciplinary team that can design, build
and <em>operate</em> the service, led by a suitably skilled and senior service manager
with decision-making responsibility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This implies a change to how many organisations have traditionally run services,
often with a team or organisation building a service separate from the one running it.
This change however does not mean ignoring existing good practice when it comes to service
management.</p>

<h2 id="agile-and-service-management">Agile and service management</h2>

<p>The principles of IT service management (ITSM) and those of agile do not necessarily
conflict &ndash; issues can arise however when organisations implement rigid processes
without considering wider service delivery matters, or design and build services
without thinking about how they will be operated.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">agile manifesto</a> makes the case for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
<li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
<li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
<li>Responding to change over following a plan</li>
</ul>

<p>It is too easy to position service management as opposed to agile as
traditional service management practices can be viewed as focusing on processes, tools,
documentation, planning and contract negotiation &ndash; the items on the right hand
side of the points above.</p>

<p>However, the agile manifesto goes on to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we
value the items on the left more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To build and run a successful service you will need to work on suitable
processes and manage third party relationships. Using existing service management
frameworks (especially as a starting point) is one approach to this problem.</p>

<h2 id="itil">ITIL</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.axelos.com/itil">ITIL</a> (the Information Technology Infrastructure
Library) is one such framework. ITIL does a particularly good job of facilitating shared
language. For instance it&rsquo;s definition of a service is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A service is a means of delivering value to customers by facilitating outcomes
customers want to achieve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The current version of ITIL currently provides 5 volumes and 26 processes
describing in detail various aspects of service management:</p>

<h3 id="service-strategy">Service Strategy</h3>

<ul>
<li>IT service management</li>
<li>Service portfolio management</li>
<li>Financial management for IT services</li>
<li>Demand management</li>
<li>Business relationship management</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="service-design">Service Design</h3>

<ul>
<li>Design coordination</li>
<li>Service Catalogue management</li>
<li>Service level management</li>
<li>Availability management</li>
<li>Capacity Management</li>
<li>IT service continuity management</li>
<li>Information security management system</li>
<li>Supplier management</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="service-transition">Service Transition</h3>

<ul>
<li>Transition planning and support</li>
<li>Change management</li>
<li>Service asset and configuration management</li>
<li>Release and deployment management</li>
<li>Service validation and testing</li>
<li>Change evaluation</li>
<li>Knowledge management</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="service-operation">Service Operation</h3>

<ul>
<li>Event management</li>
<li>Incident management</li>
<li>Request fulfillment</li>
<li>Problem management</li>
<li>Identity management</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="continual-service-improvement">Continual Service Improvement</h3>

<h3 id="functions">Functions</h3>

<p>ITIL also describes four functions that should cooperate together to form
an effective service management capability.</p>

<ul>
<li>Service operations</li>
<li>Technical management</li>
<li>Application management</li>
<li>Operations management</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-importance-of-implementation">The importance of implementation</h2>

<p>The above processes and functions make for an excellent high level list of topics
to discuss when establishing an operating model for your service, whether
or not you adopt the formal methods. In many cases if you have well understood,
well established and well documented processes in place for all of the above
you should be in a good position to run your service.</p>

<p>When looking to combine much of the rest of the guidance on the service manual
with ITIL or other service management frameworks it is important to challenge
existing implementations. This is less about the actual implementation and more often
about the problems that implementation was designed to originally solve.</p>

<h3 id="an-example-service-transition">An example &ndash; service transition</h3>

<p>As an example ITIL talks a great deal about Service Transition &ndash; getting working functionality
into the hands of the users of the service. This is a key topic for The Digital Service Standard
too which says that teams should:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Make sure that you have the capacity and technical flexibility to update and
improve the service on a very frequent basis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk">GOV.UK</a> for instance made more than 100 production releases
<a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2012/11/02/regular-releases-reduce-risk/">during its first two weeks</a> after launch.</p>

<p>This high rate of change tends to challenge existing processes designed for a
slower rate of change. If you are releasing your service every month or every 6 months
then a manual process (like a weekly or monthly in-person change approval board or CAB) may be
the most suitable approach. If you&rsquo;re releasing many times a day then the approach to how
change is evaluated, tested and managed tends towards being more automated. This
moves effort from occasional but manual activities to upfront design and automation
work. More work is put in to assure the processes rather than putting all the effort
into assuring a specific <em>transition</em>.</p>

<p>Service management frameworks tend to acknowledge this, for instance ITIL has a
concept of a standard change (something commonly done, with known risks
and hence pre-approved), but a specific implementation in a given organisation
might not.</p>

<h2 id="other-frameworks-exist">Other frameworks exist</h2>

<p>It is important to note that other service management frameworks and standards
exist, including some that are of a similar size and scope to ITIL:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_20000">ISO/IEC 20000</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/MOF">Microsoft Operations Framework</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Many organisations also use smaller processes and integrate them together.
The needs of your service and organisation will determine what works best for you.</p>

<h2 id="problematic-concepts">Problematic concepts</h2>

<p>Some traditional language tends to cause some confusion when discussing service
management alongside agile. It&rsquo;s generally best to avoid the following terms when possible,
although given their widespread usage this isn&rsquo;t always possible. It is however worth
being aware of the problems these concepts raise.</p>

<h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>

<p>Projects tend to imply a start and an end. The main goal of project work is to
complete it, to reach the end. Especially for software development the project can
too often be viewed as <em>done</em> when the software is released. What happens after that
is another problem entirely &ndash; and often someone else&rsquo;s problem.</p>

<p>However when building services the main goal is to meet user needs
These needs may change over time, and are only met by software that is running in
production and available to those users.</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean not breaking work down into easily understandable parts, but stories,
sprints and epics are much more
suited to agile service delivery.</p>

<h3 id="business-as-usual">Business as usual</h3>

<p>The concept of business as usual also clashes with a model of continuous
service improvement. It immediately brings to mind before and after
states, often with the assumption that change is both much slower and
more constrained during <em>business as usual</em>. In reality, until you put your
service in the hands of real users as part of an alpha
or beta you won&rsquo;t have all the information
needed to build the correct service. And even once you pass the live standard
you will be expected to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>continuously update and improve the service on the basis of user feedback,
performance data, changes to best practice and service demand</p>
</blockquote>

      </h1>
      <span class="post-date">Jan 1, 2017 &middot; 21 minute read
      </span>
      
      

<p><em>This post was <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/government-service-design-manual/blob/master/service-manual/operations/web-operations-stories.md">originally written</a>
as part of the Government Service Design Manual while I was working for the UK
Cabinet Office in 2013. I&rsquo;m republishing it here under the terms of the <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/2/">Open
Government licence</a>.</em></p>

<p>This document outlines the typical scope of infrastructure and web operations
(sometimes erroneously referred to as hosting) work on a large service
redesign project.</p>

<p>The sample list of user stories provided is not intended to be a complete list of
all areas of interest nor are you likely to need to do all of this for every service.
The idea is for this list to be a good starting place from where to you can write
additional stories, delete ones you do not require and split stories into smaller
ones. Importantly you also need to provide your own acceptance criteria
specific to the needs of your service.</p>

<p>Remember these stories are a placeholder for a conversation.
For some contexts, that conversation will be &lsquo;this does not apply to my
service&rsquo; &ndash; that is fine. But there will almost certainly be other stories not
listed here which do apply.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>

<p>An issue we have observed on a number of projects is a lack of understanding
early on in a project about the work required to run a large online
service. Often this is placed under  <em>hosting</em> and is investigated too late
in the process.</p>

<h2 id="intended-audience">Intended audience</h2>

<p>The hosting of a complex and sensitive software application requires a team
of people with specialist skills to design, setup and operate. Because this
work is generally not user facing and can be highly technical it is sometimes
easy to leave until later &ndash; with potentially dire consequences for launching
safely and on time.</p>

<h3 id="service-managers">Service managers</h3>

<p>Does your team have people who deeply understand this topic? If you are not an
expert then it is important to involve people permanently in the team
who are. They can explain the technical trade offs and decisions which may
affect your service.</p>

<h3 id="delivery-managers">Delivery managers</h3>

<p>As well as understanding the potentially large scope of work, many of the areas
discussed here have lead times associated with third parties. The earlier
stories related to these topics are brought into project backlogs the sooner
estimates can be made and deadlines understood.</p>

<h2 id="stories">Stories</h2>

<p>The following stories are intended to provide a starting point for any project,
rather than be a complete set. Individual projects would be expected to take
and modify stories as needed and importantly to apply their own acceptance
criteria specific to their requirements.</p>

<p>The majority of these stories are from the point of view of developers, web
operations engineers and the responsible service manager. Although not ideal,
for this particular technical topic this works reasonably well. Feel free
to change the focus when using them in your backlog.</p>

      <span class="post-date">Dec 31, 2016 &middot; 8 minute read

<p>One of the reasons I moved to Puppet two and a bit years ago was because
I was interested in the software industry. In particular I was
interested in being on the vendor side for a while. My background is
mainly as a service provider, software as a service, in-house
developer/ops type person. This has definitely been an interesting
experience, but I&rsquo;ve not tried too much to explain <em>why</em>, until now.</p>

<p>First, what do we mean by <em>vendor</em>?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a person or company offering something for sale, especially a trader
in the street.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So in the context of a software vendor we specifically mean:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a person or company offering software for sale</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that we&rsquo;re selling the software, not access to some service
provided by software (ie. SaaS). SaaS and other as-a-service models are
growing part of the industry, but the business model, development cycle,
company structure and other aspects are quite different in my experience,
though lots of hybrid models exist too.</p>

<h2 id="economics-and-scale">Economics and scale</h2>

<p>One of the interesting aspects of the software vendor world is the
economics, the revenues, and the fact lots of companies are public. This
in turn means a large amount of VC money goes into trying to create
another large software vendor, because the potential payout is huge.</p>

<p>Take a sample set of companies from the last 10 years or so that are still
private: Docker, Puppet, Chef, MongoDB, Elastic, CoreOS, Mesosphere,
Weave, Cloudera, etc. Somewhat biased towards my own interests I&rsquo;ll
admit.</p>

<p>Now take a sample of large, public, software vendors: Oracle, Microsoft,
CA, SAP, Sage, BMC, VMware. Not counting companies like Intel,
Cisco, IBM, Dell (no longer public), and HP with huge software portfolios.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s pick on Sage, a UK software company selling accounting software.
<a href="http://www.truffle100.com/2015/ranking.php">As of 2014</a> Sage had 1169
people in software development R&amp;D roles and they made $1.6billion from
software and related services in 2015. That&rsquo;s probably about the (order
of magnitude) number of people employed in R&amp;D roles in the above private
softare companies. The revenue is (and I&rsquo;m guessing here) a bit higher
at Sage than those companies combined too. SAP is an order of magnitude larger,
both in terms of people (18908 in 2014) and revenues ($18billion
also in 2014). Oracle revenues were $38billion as another data point.</p>

<p>So all the cool (or not so cool) companies from the past 10 years or so
are a rounding error to the size of the industry. But you wouldn&rsquo;t know
that from reading Hacker News or other parts of the internet. This
disconnect is a constant source of interest to me as I spend time with
Puppet customers and with the wider infrastructure community at
conferences and the like.</p>

<h2 id="a-world-of-difference">A world of difference</h2>

<p>My gut feeling is that most people working as software developers,
designers, product managers, etc. don&rsquo;t work for software vendors. Apart
from maybe in localised areas like Silicon Valley. But because of the
mentioned money and scale (and PR spend) of the big players a
great deal of press interest centers around vendors. Docker is probably the
best current example of this but it&rsquo;s more general than one company.
This makes what happens in software-vendor-startup-land more visible to
everyone else than, say, IT reality in large financial companies.</p>

<p>At the heart of a good software company is a product being
built and maintained by a team of engineers, designers, managers, etc.
In many ways this is similar to lots of peoples experience of building
software (whether at work or at home as part of one open source project
or another). But the support surrounding this tends to vary greatly from
other areas. A dedicated marketing and product marketing team, dedicated
sales staff, a professional services function, training, documentation,
public relations personell are all required to turn the software into
revenue. And importantly these teams have to work closely together, and
be actively involved with the development of the product.</p>

<p>This is very different from an in-house development position, but it&rsquo;s
also quite different from most SaaS operations. SaaS tends (generalising
here) to be based around large numbers of individual users with monthly
recurring revenues of 10s or 100s of US dollars. Software vendors
selling to large enterprises tends to be looking at single large deals
of 10s of thousands to many millions of dollars. This tends to mean
large differences in total number of customers, revenue per
customer, time needed to close a deal, requirement for staff local to a
customer, etc. All of that makes for a very different operation and
feedback cycle.</p>

<h2 id="some-interesting-observations">Some interesting observations</h2>

<p>Software has a much longer shelf-life in the real-world than people
typically think on the internet. Take the datacenter automation
market. <a href="https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/products/vrealize-suite/vmware-idc-worlwide-datacenter-automation-software-market-shares-2015.pdf">This IDC
report</a>
for example pegs the market at $2.3billion in 2015. VMware takes the
lions share with roughly 30%, with BMC with 10%. For reference Puppet
has 3.2% and Chef 1.2%. Obviously this is just one report, and it&rsquo;s now
a year old, but it&rsquo;s an interesting data point. And compare that to what
you might expect if you just follow the software rather than the market.
Even in 2015 some people would have been saying &ldquo;surely everything is
Docker and Kubernetes now?&ldquo;. The reality is closer to it being all shell
scripts and BladeLogic for the majority of IT shops.</p>

<p>For the most part, innovators (and some early adopters) don&rsquo;t buy software,
instead they build or co-opt it. Take Netflix, Uber, Amazon, Google,
Facebook or similar. All are well-known for building much of there core
software and infrastructure and using open source solutions for much of
the rest. And it&rsquo;s not just software, all of the above also have large
internal investments in bespoke hardware as well. So who buys software
from software vendors? Taking the <a href="http://www.valuebasedmanagement.net/methods_rogers_innovation_adoption_curve.html">Rogers&rsquo; Innovation Adoption
Curve</a>
it&rsquo;s the early majority, the late majority and laggards. That&rsquo;s
~85% of the market. Most of the noise on the internet about software is
from innovators and early adopters, or people who want to be in those
groups. But most of the software sold is to people with very different
wants and needs. This chasm explains much of the frustration experienced
with software, and the difficulty of building software for often very
different types of users at the same time.</p>

<p>Much of the writing about continuous delivery and continuous deployment
assumes you&rsquo;re releasing a web site or at least a central, single,
service. At the very least this is most peoples experience and context.
But shipping software than people install and run themselves tends to
make software deployment a pull rather than a push. A vendor can release
a new version, but how to make the customer upgrade? Technically this
could be reasonably straightforward (Chrome auto-updates for example)
but for expensive, often critical, systems in sometimes regulated or
otherwise controlled or low trust environments, this turns out to be
trickier and more about people than just technology. This is an entire
topic on it&rsquo;s own so I&rsquo;ll leave it there <a href="https://web.pipelineconf.info/">for
now</a>.</p>

<p>Continuous integration for packaged software (true for some, but not most,
projects outside software vendors) tends to hit a permutation explosion quite
quickly. Take server software because that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m most familiar
with. You&rsquo;ll definitely support the latest version of RHEL, plus
probably a few older versions, and maybe Centos and some of the other
variants (Oracle Linux, Scientific Linux) as well. Ubuntu LTS releases
probably makes the list, as might Debian stable. You&rsquo;ll also likely want
to test on at least Windows Server 2016 and 2012. You may have need to
keep going and support BSD, AIX, HP-UX, SUSE, etc. <a href="https://docs.puppet.com/guides/platforms.html">Puppet has an
unreasonably long list of supported and tested
platforms</a> for instance.
Throw in other variations or configurations or architectures and you
have a serious CI environment. Compare this to a more typical case of a
deployment pipeline to a single known operating system and version on
a server you control.</p>

<h2 id="open-source">Open source</h2>

<p>One of the notable things about the lists above of older (public) and
newer (currently private) software companies is that all of the newer
ones are based around an open source software product or products. We&rsquo;ve
had companies based around open source for a long time, but very few make
it to the public markets (where we get data to see if they actually work
as companies). A recent exception is Hortonworks (HDP) which
opened at $26.38 in December 2014 but is down to $8.31 as of this
writing, with revenues around <a href="http://hortonworks.com/press-releases/hortonworks-reports-financial-results-second-quarter-2016/">$40million a
quarter</a>.
Red Hat (RHT) did <a href="https://investors.redhat.com/news-and-events/press-releases/2016/03-22-2016-201734069">$2billion in
2016</a>
(which remember is 5% of Oracles revenues, but still a large amount).</p>

<p>So undoutedly open source has had a large effect on the software
industry as a whole. But the impact on the public markets to date is
minimal in terms of new companies. It will be super interesting to see
if in 5 years time the list of public software companies based on open
source software is larger than it is today.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>I mainly wrote this post so I had something to reference when I talk to
people about the software industry, and in particular what it&rsquo;s like
working for a software vendor. Speculating about or second guessing one
vendor or another is an internet sport (non-more-so than for those that
work at other vendors) but from the outside it&rsquo;s worth an appreciation
of some of the differences I think and a bit of empathy for the
decisions made. And if the above makes you think this all sounds rather
interesting then you&rsquo;d be right.</p>

<p>Very few people today start using Linux by downloading the linux kernel
and starting from scratch. Most people start with a Linux distribution;
for instance Debian, Ubuntu or CentOS. These distributions provide some
opinions, some central infrastructure, a brand, strong versioning for
the entire ecosystem and a bunch of other things. I posit that we&rsquo;ll see
the same pattern emerge with Kubernetes.</p>

<h2 id="what-even-is-kubernetes">What even is Kubernetes?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen Kubernetes described as all of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>An operating system for your datacenter</li>
<li>The distributed systems toolkit</li>
<li>The Linux kernel for distributed systems</li>
</ul>

<p>I think all of these descriptions point to the developers intent that
Kubernetes is something to build upon, rather than a simple out-of-the-box
experience. It&rsquo;s predominantly about building agreement on the
primitives/APIs of distributed systems.</p>

<h2 id="a-name-for-a-thing">A name for a thing</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve not seen much discussion of this in general yet, I think because
it&rsquo;s early days and many of the people looking at Kubernetes today are
either developers or early adopter types. These people have been
&ldquo;downloading the kernel and starting from scratch&rdquo;, even until recently
most likely running from source downloaded directly from GitHub. If the
Kubernetes ecosystem is to grow then that&rsquo;s not how more mainstream IT
will adopt Kubernetes.</p>

<p>The reason for discussing this now is that I think a name is useful.
That way we can talk about Kubernetes (singular, the software) separate
from distrubutions of Kubernetes (many of them, from different vendors
and communities). I&rsquo;d be happy to see a different name, but I think
distribution probably fits best.</p>

<h2 id="any-evidence">Any evidence?</h2>

<p>Absolutely. A range of software vendors are providing what I&rsquo;m calling
Kubernetes distributions. Here is a sample, I&rsquo;m sure there are and will
be more. I&rsquo;m also sure over time some will disappear or maintain only a
niche audience.</p>

<ul>
<li>OpenShift from Red Hat</li>
<li>Tectonic from CoreOS</li>
<li>Kismatic from Apprenda</li>
<li>Rancher</li>
<li>Canonical Distribution of Kubernetes</li>
<li>GKE from Google</li>
<li>Azure Container Service from Microsoft</li>
<li>Photon Platform from VMware</li>
<li>Navops from Univa</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that Canonical are already using the term <em>distribution</em> in the
name. I&rsquo;ve seen it used in passing in CoreOS, OpenShift and Apprenda
press materials too.</p>

<h2 id="what-can-we-expect-from-kubernetes-distributions">What can we expect from Kubernetes distributions?</h2>

<p>Running with the analogy that Kubernetes is &ldquo;an operating system for
your datacenter&rdquo; and that we&rsquo;ll have a range of competing Kubernetes
distributions, what else can we expect over the next few years?</p>

<h3 id="package-repositories-aka-app-stores">Package repositories (aka. app stores)</h3>

<p>One of the things provided by the traditional Linux distributions has
been a central package repository. Most of the packages you&rsquo;re
installing from <code>apt</code> or <code>yum</code> are coming from that currated set of
available packages. Not to mention community efforts like EPEL. We
already have two package concepts within the Kubernetes ecosystem -
container images (often from Docker Hub today, or from internal
repositories) and Charts, part of the Helm package management tool
(now a CNCF project).</p>

<p>In the short term expect the shared public Charts repository and Docker
Hub to dominate. But over time different vendors will launch there own
repositories. Partly this will be about building a trusted ecosystem,
partly about limiting permutations for support and testing, and partly
about control. The prize here is to be &ldquo;the enterprise app store&rdquo; and
no vendor in this space isn&rsquo;t going to at least try to own that as part
of their platform.</p>

<h3 id="kubernetes-standards-and-compliance">Kubernetes standards and compliance</h3>

<p>In an environment with many distributors of core software, it&rsquo;s
common for people to emphasise portability. As vendors extend their
distribution (to provide higher level, but potentially proprietary
features) this can become muddier. Some level of certification is
often the answer. See CloudFoundry or OpenStack for recent examples.
Kubernetes is already part of the CNCF, part of the Linux Foundation.
I&rsquo;d expect to see the works standards and certification eventually
float around, but my guess is not in the short term.</p>

<h3 id="a-fight-over-who-is-the-most-open">A fight over who is the most open</h3>

<p>Much of the container conversation recently has centered around a
<em>weaponisation</em> of <em>open</em>. I think as the different distributions try and
take the community with them at the same time as trying to scale sales this
will continue. This will be an irritation and is probably best avoided.</p>

<h3 id="pressure-for-aws-to-offer-kubernetes-as-a-service">Pressure for AWS to offer Kubernetes as a service</h3>

<p>I would presume AWS has a very good idea of how many people are actually
using Kubernetes on it&rsquo;s platform. I think as that grows, and as other
vendors efforts mature, they will come under pressure to offer the
Kubernetes API as a service. I&rsquo;m still split on whether that will
actually happen but that&rsquo;s a longer blog post about economics.</p>

<h3 id="differentiating-features">Differentiating features</h3>

<p>Ultimately vendors will try and differentiate themselves in this new
market. To begin with the majority of business will be targetting the
container-curious and mainly talking up the benefits of containers and
Kubernetes. But some potentialy customers are going to insist on
comparing Kubernetes distributions and winning there is going to be about
clear differentiation. Do you want to be the budget offering or the
provider with the unique selling point?</p>

<h2 id="interesting-questions">Interesting questions</h2>

<p>An observation at the moment is that all the current Kubernetes
distributions I&rsquo;m aware of are vendor-owned. Whether Open Source or not,
they are driven by a single vendor (CoreOS, Red Hat, Apprenda, etc.)
It&rsquo;s interesting to see whether, in the current climate, we see a
genuinely free and open source Kubernetes distribution emerge, similar
to the role Debian plays in the Linux distribution world.</p>
