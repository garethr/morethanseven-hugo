    <p>As a wandering web designer cum developer and now occasional consultant I&rsquo;m generally pretty technology agnostic. At some point or another I&rsquo;ve written HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, C#, Python and Rails for a living - often on the same day. But something has me thinking and I thought I&rsquo;d see what other people thought as well.</p>

<p>That thing is <em>Java</em>. I have books on Java. I&rsquo;ve done the usual examples (hello world in 20 lines for instance). I didn&rsquo;t really like it and left it at that. But a few presentations, both from Google, at both <a href="http://future-of-mobile.com/">Future of Mobile</a> and <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmediaAjax/">@media Ajax</a> got me thinking. First you have <a href="http://code.google.com/android/">Android</a> in the mobile space which Dave Burke did a good job of making look pretty interesting. Then you had the guys from <a href="http://ajaxian.com">Ajaxian</a> talking about using Java for <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">everything</a>.</p>

<p>A few other thinks to throw into the pot. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Beyond-Java-Bruce-Tate/dp/0596100949">Beyond Java</a> is an interesting read - summing up with a call for more fragmentation and for small nimble languages to be used where it makes sense. Oh, and I think <a href="http://tommorris.org/blog/">Tom</a> is busy learning Java as well. Mmmmm.</p>

<p>Some good coverage around of <a href="http://ben-ward.co.uk/journal/ajaxising/">both</a> <a href="http://www.blackphoebe.com/msjen/2007/11/london-day-6-future.html#more">conferences</a> and I know my first impression was basically <em>this way lies madness</em>. But it would have been more interesting had their been a few more Java people around to argue with.</p>

<p>Note that I&rsquo;m not advocating a Google like disregard for the web here. Markup really matters, I happen to disagree with <a href="http://crockford.com/">Douglas</a> and think CSS rocks and I love writing Javascript. But should we just learn Java anyhow and try to subvert some of the existing tools to be more web like?</p>
