    <p>One of the many things I did some work on while at
<a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/">GDS</a> back in 2013 was the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual">Government Service Design
Manual</a>. This was intended to be a
central resource for teams across (and outside) Government about how to
go about building, designing and running modern internet-era services.
It was a good snapshot of opinions from the people that made up GDS on a
wide range of different topics. Especially for the people who spent time
in the field with other departments, having an official viewpoint published
publicly was hugely helpful.</p>

<p>Recently the Service Manual <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/12/19/introducing-the-next-stage-of-the-service-manual/">got a bit of a relaunch</a>
but unfortunately this involved deleting much of the content about
operations and running a service. Even more unfortunately the service
manual is now described as something that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>exists to help people across government build services that meet the
Digital Service Standard and prepare for service assessments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So in basic terms it&rsquo;s refocusing on helping people pass the exam rather
than being all about learning. Which is a shame. Compare that with the
original intent:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Build services so good that people prefer to use them</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, all that content is not lost. Luckily the content is <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/government-service-design-manual">archived on GitHub</a>
and was published under the terms of the <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/2/">Open Government License</a>
which allows for anyone to <em>&ldquo;copy, publish, distribute and transmit the Information&rdquo;</em>.
So I&rsquo;m choosing to republish a few of the pieces I wrote and found
useful when talking to and assisting other Government departments. These
represent an interesting snapshot from a few years ago, but I think
mainly stand the test of time, even if I&rsquo;d change a few things if I
wrote them today.</p>
