<p><em>This post was originally written as part of the Government Service
Design Manual while I was working for the UK Cabinet Office. Since my
original in 2013 it was improved upon <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/government-service-design-manual/blob/master/service-manual/operations/devops.md">by several
others</a>
I&rsquo;m republishing it here under the terms of the <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/2/">Open Government
licence</a>.</em></p>

<p>Devops is a cultural and professional movement in response to the
mistakes commonly made by large organisations. Often organisations will
have very separate units for:</p>

<ul>
<li>development</li>
<li>quality assurance</li>
<li>operations business</li>
</ul>

<p>In extreme cases these units may be:</p>

<ul>
<li>based in different locations</li>
<li>work for different organisations</li>
<li>under completely different management structures</li>
</ul>

<p>Communication costs between these units, and their individual
incentives, leads to slow delivery and a mountain of interconnected
processes.</p>

<p>This is what Devops aims to correct. It is not a methodology or
framework, but a set of principles and a willingness to break down
silos. Specifically Devops is all about:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#culture">culture</a></li>
<li><a href="#automation">automation</a></li>
<li><a href="#measurement">measurement</a></li>
<li><a href="#sharing">sharing</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="culture">Culture</h3>

<p>Devops needs a change in attitude so shared ownership and collaboration
are the common working practices in building and managing a service.
This culture change is especially important for established
organisations.</p>

<h3 id="automation">Automation</h3>

<p>Many business processes are ready to be automated. Automation removes
manual, error-prone tasks &ndash; allowing people to concentrate on the
quality of the service. Common areas that benefit from automation are:</p>

<ul>
<li>release management (releasing software)</li>
<li>provisioning</li>
<li>configuration management</li>
<li>systems integration</li>
<li>monitoring</li>
<li>orchestration (the arrangement and maintenance of complex computer
systems)</li>
<li>testing</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="measurement">Measurement</h3>

<p>Data can be incredibly powerful for implementing change, especially when
it’s used to get people from different groups involved in the quality of
the end-to-end service delivery. Collecting information from different
teams and being able to compare it across former silos can implement
change on its own.</p>

<h3 id="sharing">Sharing</h3>

<p>People from different backgrounds (ie development and operations) often
have different, but overlapping skill sets. Sharing between groups will
spread an understanding of the different areas behind a successful
service, so encourage it. Resolving issues will then be more about
working together and not negotiating contracts.</p>

<h2 id="why-devops">Why Devops</h2>

<p>The quality of your service will be compromised if teams can&rsquo;t work
together, specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li>those who build and test software</li>
<li>those that run it in production</li>
</ul>

<p>The root cause is often functional silos; when one group owns a specific
area (say quality) it’s easy for other areas to assume that it’s no
longer their concern.</p>

<p>This attitude is toxic, especially in areas such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>quality</li>
<li>release management</li>
<li>performance</li>
</ul>

<p>High quality digital services need to be able to adapt quickly to user
needs, and this can only happen with close collaboration between
different groups.</p>

<p>Make sure the groups in your team:</p>

<ul>
<li>have a shared sense of ownership of the service</li>
<li>have a shared sense of the problem</li>
<li>develop a culture of making measurable improvements to how things work</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="good-habits">Good habits</h2>

<p>Devops isn’t a project management methodology, but use these good habits
in your organisation. While not unique to Devops, they help with
breaking down silos when used with the above principles:</p>

<ul>
<li>cross-functional teams &ndash; make sure your
teams are made up of people from different functions (this helps with
the team owning the end-to-end quality of service and makes it easier to
break down silos)</li>
<li>widely shared metrics &ndash; it’s important
for everyone to know what ‘good’ looks like so share high and low
level metrics as widely as possible as it builds understanding</li>
<li>automating repetitive tasks &ndash; use software development to automate
tasks across the service as it:

<ul>
<li>encourages a better understanding of the whole service</li>
<li>frees up smart people from doing repetitive manual tasks</li>
</ul></li>
<li>post-mortems &ndash; issues will happen so it’s critical that everyone
across different teams learns from them; running post-mortems (an
analysis session after an event) with people from different groups is a
great way of spreading knowledge</li>
<li>regular releases
&ndash; the capacity for releasing software is often limited in siloed
organisations, because the responsibilities of the different parts of
the release are often spread out across teams &ndash; getting to a point
where you can release regularly (even many times a day) requires extreme
collaboration and clever automation</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="warning-signs">Warning signs</h2>

<p>Like agile, the term Devops is often used for marketing or promotional
purposes. This leads to a few common usages, which aren’t necessarily in
keeping with what’s been said here. Watch out for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Devops tools (nearly always marketing)</li>
<li>a Devops team (in many cases this is just a new silo of skills and
knowledge)</li>
<li>Devops as a job title (you wouldn’t call someone “an agile”)</li>
</ul>
