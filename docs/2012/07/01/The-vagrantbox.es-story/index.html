    <p>A few weeks ago now <a href="http://www.vagrantbox.es/">Vagrantbox.es</a> (a website I maintain for third party hosted <a href="http://vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> base boxes) dissapeared from the internet for a few days. This was completely my fault, the (lovely) hosting people <a href="https://www.ep.io/">ep.io</a> had unfortunately closed down the service they had in beta and I&rsquo;d been so busy that I hadn&rsquo;t had chance to move it elsewhere.</p>

<p>The original version of the site (I had the code and good backups of the data) was a pretty simple Django application, but I&rsquo;d used it to experiment (read over-engineer) with various bits of tech including Varnish, Solr, some ORM caching and lots more. This had been great, but it made it less portable. I had everything described in Puppet, but with virtually no spare time I decided to go a different route.</p>

<p>I threw a flat version of the site up on <a href="https://github.com/garethr/vagrantboxes-heroku">GitHub</a>, served it using Nginx on <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> and added a quick <em>Fork me on GitHub</em> badge to the top. Suggest a box moved from being a web form to a pull request. It&rsquo;s fair to say I did this pretty quickly and made a good few typos on the way. But within a couple of weeks I&rsquo;ve had 8 pull requests either fixing my bugs, removing dead boxes and adding new ones.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;m going to take from this is, if you&rsquo;re building a community project that&rsquo;s aimed at developers, then throw the content on GitHub. In my case I have the entire site on there too but I think that&rsquo;s secondary. Pull requests are much better than any content management system or workflow you&rsquo;re likely to build, and even more importantly the time to implement something drops hugely.</p>

<p>With all the spare time I don&rsquo;t have I&rsquo;ll be thinking about a content management model using GitHub for content, pull requests for workflow and post commit hooks for loading that content into a site or service somewhere.</p>
