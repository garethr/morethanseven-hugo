    <p><a href="http://neilcrosby.com/">Neil Crosby</a> got me thinking yesterday about which language to learn/play with next by <a href="http://twitter.com/NeilCrosby/statuses/2090500164">tweeting</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>so, lovely people of the interwebs. What webly language should I be spending my time learning then? Right now, I&rsquo;m all about the PHP.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Neil appears to have gone for Python, but more specifically I&rsquo;m interested in how you decide what to learn next? And improving the likelihood of you seeing it through and being able to add it to you toolbox. Personally I&rsquo;ve messed around with a wide range of languages but I would say I&rsquo;m proficient in only a few of those.</p>

<p>So here goes with a list of questions to ask yourself.</p>

<ul>
<li>Do you have a small pet project you can use the new language on straight away?</li>
<li>Is the language increasing or decreasing in popularity?</li>
<li>Does the language overlap with what you already know in terms of applicability?</li>
<li>Is it a different style of programming to what you&rsquo;re used to? Say a pure functional language if all you normally do is object orientated.</li>
<li>Is the language in demand in the jobs market? If not why not?</li>
<li>Could you use the language in your current job if you were allowed to?</li>
<li>What are the learning materials like? Are there books or websites that teach the language without passing on bad practices.</li>
<li>What is the community around a language like? Do they have an IRC room where beginners can ask questions without being mocked?</li>
<li>Does the language have an interactive mode? Sorry but I find anything without to be a chore to learn.</li>
<li>What is it going to cost you in terms of time? Remember some languages are bigger that others.</li>
<li>What is it going to cost you in terms of money? Do you need specialist software, or hardware, or licenses?</li>
<li>Do you have friends or acquaintances who use the language and who will help you out with pointing you in the right direction of resources or helping review your code?</li>
<li>Do you have somewhere you can go to meet other people who write the language. That might be a formal user group or it might just be a more general pub meetup that you know a few people attend.</li>
<li>How is the language represented on GitHub? Seeing what other people build and being able to read working code is hugely useful when learning anything.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think all of these apply to everyone or apply all the time, but it&rsquo;s worth considering and rejecting them when they don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Feel free to disagree in the comments or, even better, add extra ones. Or alternatively just cut to the chase and tell me what I should learn next.</p>
