    <p>It&rsquo;s the start of another year so that means it&rsquo;s time to start thinking about conferences.</p>

<p>I just found out at the end of last week (<a href="http://twitter.com/binarytales/status/1106721057">via Twitter no less</a>) that I&rsquo;ve been confirmed as one of the speakers for <a href="http://bamboojuice.co.uk">Bamboo Juice</a>. Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/binarytales">Jon</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/richquick">Rich</a> for having me. I&rsquo;m really looking forward to that as it&rsquo;s a new event outside London (at the rather fabulous looking Eden project in Cornwall), which should hopefully mean a chance for a new set of people to go along to what looks like a decent event. I&rsquo;ll have more information about what I&rsquo;m going to be talking about some time between then and now I would imagine, but the emphasis is on practical learnings for working developers and designers.</p>

<p>Apart from that the only other conference I&rsquo;ve confirmed I&rsquo;l be attending so far is <a href="http://www.thinkingdigital.co.uk/">Thinking Digital</a> in May. It was great last year even if I spent the majority of the time running round organising barcamp, moving house or leaving Newcastle. This time I&rsquo;m not involved in any organising (<a href="http://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1095746624">sorry Andy</a>) so I plan on making the most of the talks and general experience. Rumour has it that their will be another barcamp as well so I&rsquo;ll look forward to that too. It will be good to get back up to Newcastle and see people again.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also looking forward to <a href="http://twitter.com/ptg/status/1096802734">what Patrick is up to for @media</a>. It was the conference that started this whole thing rolling in the UK back in the day and now it appears it might be set for a change.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Time to finalise the line-up and web site for a very different (and lower price!) @media &lsquo;09</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As well as these three I&rsquo;ll be keeping my eye out for any news about Xtech, The Highland Fling and any other new upcoming conferences. If you know of anything else leave a comment. I didn&rsquo;t find out about <a href="http://www.thinkvisibility.com/">Think Visibility</a> until it had sold out but I like the idea of smaller, specialised events.</p>

<p>Overall it already looks like being a good year for conference goers in the UK. I&rsquo;ll be on the lookout for barcamp style events as well but I do like a good formal conference as well. Hopefully see a few people at some of these events?</p>
