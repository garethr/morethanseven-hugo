    <p>As I think a few people are aware I&rsquo;ll be leaving <a href="http://thisisglobal.com">Global</a> at the end of May.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s going to have been a pretty good year all told. I got to work with some great people and we built some pretty good stuff from the group up. The <a href="http://www.capitalradio.co.uk/">Capital Radio</a> website was part of it but it&rsquo;s the systems behind the scenes where all the interestingness lies. But as the team as a whole was just getting started the economy got bored of growing each year and went south. Global is first and foremost a radio company that makes money from advertising and, in need of cash, it decided to <a href="http://radiotoday.co.uk/news.php?extend.4270">cut lots of the interactive department</a>. All of that meant lots of redundancies and less interesting work and I decided I&rsquo;d rather go now than wait around.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an odd situation to be in but I&rsquo;m not going to dwell on that and I&rsquo;m not bitter about any of the goings on. I got to play with Django full time in what, I think, was the biggest Django development team in the UK. I got to work, and argue, with smart people every day. We had two internal hackdays where I got to play with XMPP and messaging apps. And I&rsquo;m definitely a far better programmer than a year ago.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be sticking around at Global for the next three months to finish off a number of projects that I&rsquo;ve been involved in and tidy up a few loose ends, as well as to work out what to do next. Which is where you (might) come in. Think of it like a job vacancy in reverse.</p>

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m looking for a job to start in June or thereabouts.</li>
<li>I live in Cambridge and have been working in London for the last 9 months, so I don&rsquo;t mind a commute. I&rsquo;d also consider something that had me working remotely and traveling further afield as needed.</li>
<li>My main focus is on finding something where I get to <em>build interesting things</em>. By that I mean a web development role that also involves bit of system design and other bits thrown in.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d like something that tallies with my current interests. This blog, <a href="http://slideshare.net/garethr">Slideshare</a> and <a href="http://github.com/garethr">my GitHub profile</a> should give you an idea about what they are but to name but a few: testing, REST, APIs, messaging, content distribution, aggregation and development team tools.</li>
<li>Technology wise I&rsquo;d be more than happy with something using Python or Ruby. I&rsquo;d love to do more than just play around at home with Erlang as well, or the opportunity to pick up Scala. Having said all that if it&rsquo;s interesting enough I don&rsquo;t mind too much, I learn new tricks for fun and have 3 months of free time to kill.</li>
<li>Big company or small? It depends on the company, and probably depends more on the people. I&rsquo;d choose smart people over a fancy company name any day of the week. I also don&rsquo;t mind the idea of getting involved with a startup where some salary is offset against equity - but only if the idea is good enough.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve got around 8 years of wide ranging professional experience, I write articles, speak at conferences and get things done. I know roughly what the going rate for good professional web developers is as well.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=gareth+rushgrove">Ask the internet about me</a> if you want to know more.</li>
</ul>

<p>So if anyone knows of something that would be up my street I&rsquo;d be grateful. Even better, if you or your company are looking for someone at the moment and don&rsquo;t mind waiting a few months then I might be what you&rsquo;re looking for. For those that don&rsquo;t already have an email address you can find me on <a href="mailto:gareth@morethanseven.net">gareth@morethanseven.net</a></p>

<p>(There is obviously a chance that you might be a recruiter, rather than someone who wants me to work with or for them. I won&rsquo;t ignore you out of hand but please don&rsquo;t try and ring me unless I ask you to. Email is both quicker and easier for me to deal with. Also if you just want my CV for your files, have only a vague job description, or you want to tell me about a job in a company you can&rsquo;t tell me the name of please don&rsquo;t be offended if I don&rsquo;t get back to you.)</p>
