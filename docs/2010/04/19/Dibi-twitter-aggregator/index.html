    <p>So, <a href="http://dibiconference.com/">DIBI</a> is just over a week away and lots of people seem to be getting excited. Personally I&rsquo;m really looking forward to it. I get a nice trip back up to my old home of Newcastle and get to talk geek to an audience of likeminded (and not so likeminded) web professionals. I&rsquo;m also going to catch up with quite a few people I haven&rsquo;t seen in quite a while.</p>

<p>Anyway, Twitter is at it&rsquo;s best at conferences like this. It&rsquo;s perfect for the <em>where to go now</em> situation. But I also like going back in time after the fact and looking at what people said, especially to get feedback about my talk. With that in mind I&rsquo;ve build a <a href="http://dibiconf.appspot.com/">little aggregator</a> for all things #dibi. So far that appears to be a mixture of excitement and travel chaos.</p>

<p>I specifically wanted something that ran on the server, which discounted an awful lot of pure javascript versions. I think Twitter clients generally do a good job of the <em>right now</em> anyway. I also like to collect data for mining later, assuming I have the time. After a number of discussions on Twitter, then just some wandering around GitHub I found <a href="http://github.com/steffentchr/twitterengine">TwitterEngine</a> which is fantastic. I&rsquo;ve hacked it around quite a bit into something more general purpose. I&rsquo;ve added some caching, some other App Engine performance tweaks and some monitoring. I&rsquo;ll commit those to GitHub when I get the chance. I&rsquo;d forgotten quite how much fun App Engine development was.</p>

<p>I still want to add a few more features before the conference. The styles work quite well on my Android but less well (text too small) on my iPod Touch. So I&rsquo;ll fix that first. Any other requests?</p>
