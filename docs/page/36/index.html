I’m playing with a few thinks at the moment and one of those had me thinking of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_cloud">tag clouds</a>. For those who dont spend time on <a href="http://flickr.com">flickr</a> or similar you may not have seen then, or at least heard of the terminology. All we are really taking about here is a visually weighted list.

</p>
<p>
I dont agree with <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0505a.shtml">Jeffrey here</a> unfortunately, who has issues. I can see the point, that sometimes information is better organised by one person than many (think your weekly food shopping list) but in some cases it can be nice – especially where it provides an alternative navigation method. Maybe I just missed the part where everyone had a tag cloud? I’d love to see, for instance, a tag cloud on <a href="http://last.fm">last.fm</a> of bands that I might like based on my listening habits, and those of a similar musical persuasion.

</p>
<p>
An <a href="http://www.joelamantia.com/blog/archives/ideas/second_generation_tag_clouds.html">interesting article</a> on where next for tags clouds throws up a few interesting points but one thing I have not seen discussed at all is the accessibility angle. Visual prominence is one thing, but without some sort of semantic prominence those not viewing the content visually lose out. A very unscientific survery involving the <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/">del.icio.us tag cloud</a> confirmed what I though would probably be the case – the visual effects (ie. bigger or highlighted text) are implemented purely via classes on the links.

</p>
<p>
What would be the effect of using plain links, moving to <em>emphasis</em> for the next level, up to <strong>strong</strong> for the really important tags? We can style the content exactly the same as before, but we have added some sematic prominence to the content.

</p>
<p>
Anyone had any experience implementing tag clouds in live projects? Even better, anyone had experience of user testing such interface devices? Real bonus points for accessibility related testing.

I had cause today to stop and think about books relevant to learning the bigger picture side of building web sites and applications. Code, graphic design, whatever your bag in between, you are either aiming to become, will become or at least affected by people in management positions. Even small companies are not immune, though they can avoid some of the problems (but often by causing some other ones as well.)

</p>
<p>
I’m a big fan of books, I read lots online but when it comes to regular, night after night reading I much prefer to be in bed with a book than a laptop. I have no problem at all falling asleep and the book falling lightly on the floor for the morning.

</p>
<p>
Books do however date, or rather some do, or maybe if you take them as gospel they do. Anyhow, I see them as useful – perhaps even more so in distilling knowledge for consumption by other, less obsessive, members of out industry?

</p>
<p>
Without further ado I present a short(ish) list of books I think everyone involved in web software should read:

</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/020161622X">The Pragmatic Programmer</a>

</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0974514047">Ship It!: A Practical Guide to Successful Software Projects</a>

</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596001088">The Cathedral & the Bazaar</a>

</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735713286">Web Design on a Shoestring</a>

</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735712026">Return on Design: Smarter Web Design for Hard Times </a>

</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735712018">Designing with Web Standards</a>

</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0789723700">The Art and Science of Web Design</a>

</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201835959">The Mythical Man Month</a>

</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735714339">Web Redesign Workflow that Works</a>

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Some are most definately on the software side, others very web centric while more still are a little older and just plain odd. However all of them serve a purpose, they let people see into a way of thinking. The idea that programmers are <em>wizards</em> annoys me. It’s not magic, it’s creativity, just with tools most people are not familiar with.

</p>
<p>
If you are someone involved with the building of appications give some of the above a try if you ever feel like reading up on something different, apart from the latest <a href="http://cssmastery.com">CSS</a> or <a href="http://domscripting.com/">Javascript</a> tricks.

</p>
<p>
If your involved in the management of projects but come from a non software (dont kid yourself because it’s the web it’s not software) background then dive in. You’ll start to understand some of the little bits that puzzle you so.

</p>
<p>
Anyone else got any books in a similar vein? I’m always on the look out for an interesting read. Or do you complely disagree – do you even still read books?

I’ve finally decided that <a href="http://pear.php.net">PEAR</a> is a good thing. For those unfamiliar with it it’s a little like CPAN for Perl. For those unfamiliar with <em>that</em> it’s a repository of high quality PHP code, covering everything from benchmarking and debugging to database abstraction.

</p>
<p>
I’m about to dive back into PHP after a minor break playing with mainly client side toys, and with my work now mainly on the markup/styles and planning side of things PHP is a nice break. <strong>PHP isn’t the devil</strong> as far as I’m concerned, and I think now I’ve grown up PEAR is part of the non devil like side to PHP – the professional side if you will.

</p>
<p>
I like PHP for it’s flexibility. The same problems this causes in terms of it being easy to write poor, unmaintainable code are the same boons in brings if you use it nicely. I dont want static typing, on occasion being able to get down and dirty with procedural code is handy and with so much <em>good</em> code out there in places like PEAR it’s often very quick to put together something from existing parts.

</p>
<p>
I even went as far as getting a book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590592808/104-7139045-1616718?v=glance&#38;n=283155">PHP Tools</a> to have a good going through. I’ve been on something of a mad web design book shopping spree of late, so I’ll try do a quick round up of books soon as well.

</p>
<p>
Anyone else have much playtime with PEAR, or similar code repositories?

</p>
<p>

Web applications are still evolving. This we know. One thing any power user tends to pick up on pretty quickly in desktop applications is the keyboard shortcuts. We just cant get enought of them. Why dont we see them more in web applications? Well a couple of reasons as it happens:

</p>
<ul>
<li>
Potential clashes with browser or OS shortcuts

</li>
<li>
Many web applications are still evolving from more promotional websites. The learning curve for a website <em>needs</em> to be instantaneous, otherwise your potential customer just left. But what about a web application? The users may <em>have</em> to use it, as well as having documentation and maybe even training.

</li>
<li>
Because we dont see them in web applications? The circular argument.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Personally I think in some cases keyboard shortcuts would be nice, I have a little plan for something in mind as well so started experimenting. The clash issue I’m going to leave for another post as it will take a bit of brute force experimenting but I did start playing with a simple way of assigning functions to keys.

</p>
<p>
The following code creates an object to store the lookup/hash/two dimensional array (pick one you like). This is a simple associate between a key, and a function to run when it’s pressed. A function is then assigned to the onkeyup and onkeydown events which monitors them, checks for one of the keys in the lookup to be pressed (in this case along with the ctrl key) and runs the assigned function.

</p>
<div>
<code>

    &lt;txp:php&gt;
    include('/www/htdocs/morethanseven/scripts/sample/keyPress.js');
    &lt;/txp:php&gt;

</code>

</div>
<p>
A simple library function is used to add the event to the document onload. My library obviously includes other helper functions but we dont need any of those for this example.

</p>
<div>
<code>

    &lt;txp:php&gt;
    include('/www/htdocs/morethanseven/scripts/sample/lib.js'); 
    &lt;/txp:php&gt;

</code>

</div>
<p>
Some improvements I can spot from here which I’ll implement as I actually take this out of the lab and into something production like.

</p>
<ul>
<li>
JSON (or YAML) data storage. Either one makes configuration simpler and scores geek points. It’s a win win.

</li>
<li>
Abstract the use of the ctrl key from the function and allow other modifiers to be set when used.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
I’ll try get round to the look at keyboard shortcut clashes, or link to someone who already has, as I get round to it. In the mean time, what do people think about the use of keyboard shortcuts in web applications? Any good or bad examples welcome.

Last friday I got the chance to stick around in London and attend the <a href="http://clearleft.com">Clearleft</a> Ajax workshop with <a href="http://adactio.com">Jeremy Keith</a>. 30 people from different web disciplines and backgrounds trying to get as much out of a single day on the latest buzz word has to sound like fun?

</p>
<p>
I had heard Jeremy’s speak before at <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2006">@media</a> last year where he was one of the highlights and friday was much of the same. In a good way. Clear, to the point, explanations. Examples where they help to make a point, some wry humour and the odd culinary simile. The only real let down there was he’s <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adactio/96454214/">cut his hair short</a>. This tendency for <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andybudd/98405129/in/pool-summit2006/">minimalism in hair cuts</a> amongst <a href="http://htmldog.com">web designers</a> is disturbing me. Only <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andybudd/98405572/in/pool-summit2006/">Norm</a> can <a href="http://cackhanded.net/">save us now</a>.

</p>
<p>
Back on topic the day covered everything from theory and first principals to some fully working examples, but stuck with playing with Javascript and code from scratch, rather than frameworks and server side stuff. A descision I think really made the day useful.

</p>
<p>
The morning was, to be fair, less useful from my standpoint. The speed introduction to Javascript, and some of the concepts of Ajax where covering ground I’d already covered personally. That’s not to say they weren’t well placed or interesting though, far from it, and did provide some people with what was probably the best crash course in Javascript imaginable.

</p>
<p>
The afternoon really kicked into gear though. Lots of examples; from simple updating content through to making use of the Yahoo API. Throw in some examples with server side code, the obligatory shopping basket example and, particularly impressive, a detailed look at JSON. This all in one afternoon remember.

</p>
<p>
The code examples we got to take away with, and much of this was generic enough to have already found it’s way into my working library. I’m very much a fan of Jeremy’s DIY ethic with regards Javascript. I too am sceptical of using huge frameworks to crack nuts without a clue about what they are doing. The actual simplicity of the Ajax methods I think was one thing that Jeremy got over better than anyone I’ve listened to date. It really is about application design more than new, fancy, complex technology.

</p>
<p>
A few other people who attended have posted <a href="http://www.molly.com/2006/02/17/jeremy-keith-and-the-truth-about-ajax/">their</a> <a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/index.php/2006/ajax-hijax-and-accessibility/">opinions</a> .<em>I’m really not stalking Molly by the way</em>.

</p>
<p>
As Molly had hinted, Jermey is also very quotable. So here are a few of the things I’m sure he said, any loss of context here is completely my fault though:

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The validator is my friend

</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
What’s the problem? Reality! (refering to IE)

</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
DOM is like a scalpel, innerHTML is like a sledgehammer!

</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
It’s hard to argue with one line of code (on innerHTML vs DOM)

</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
Pointing at Google maps as an example of Ajax is like pointing at a ferari on a race course as an example of the combustion engine. You spend most of your time going wow!

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We closed up the afternoon with some discussion of the accessibility concerns, some of the development issues (wireframing ajax apps anyone?) and a whistle stop look at frameworks. All in all a very useful day, both personally (ie. I had fun) and professionally (I think my employer got value for money.) It also reinforced what I’ve been thinking more and more recently. It’s nearly all about design when it comes to real work. <em>When</em> and <em>where</em> and <em>why</em> must come first, and <em>how</em> is often more trivial than you think.

      <p>
Some people think that <a href="http://www.lscheffer.com/malbolge.shtml">programming should be hard</a> while others, like me, quite like the idea of anyone being able to build things, especially web sites. To me the fact that either of my housemates (non IT types) could probably build a website this evening if they so choose is great. And to be honest if they did I’d be unlikely to complain about the code or the programme they chose to build it with (Ok, I would, but that’s me and I’d like to pretend I wouldn’t.)

</p>
<p>
It’s pretty unlikely however that either of them, or any beginnner, would go along the route of choosing say <a href="http://asp.net">ASP.NET</a> or <a href="http://rubyonrails.com">Ruby on Rails</a> for that first site. Which leads me to some sort of assumption – <em>that both of these</em> are for experts and <a href="http://www.molly.com/2005/11/14/web-standards-and-the-new-professionalism/">professionals</a>. There are other facets which could be used to back up this argument but I dont want to go on – rails making use of the command line (in very cool ways) or ASP.NET requiring IIS configuration for a start. Not something I fancy talking non experts through to be fair.

</p>
<p>
Using that assumption brings me nicely to helpers. Both are frameworks that try (and in may places succeed) in making life easier for developers. This is a good thing. What’s not so good is where this goes too far, in my opinion. ASP.NET <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemwebuiwebcontrolslinkbuttonclasstopic.asp">linkButtons</a> are simply Evil. No questions. At All. Stop using them. Now. Rails wades in as well with it’s reliance, when it comes to certain controls, on inline Javascript. Did someone not get the <a href="http://adactio.com/atmedia2005/">memo</a>?

</p>
<p>
As good web standards people we have divided content from presentation. Behaviour from both (sort of). Now we have great (in both senses of the word) frameworks coming along and riding roughshod over our labour of love to make the web a better place. Making the developers life easier, but impacting negatively on the end users. Such wide ranging and powerful tools for experts need not treat all users as experts in everything. ASP.NET (or Ruby on Rails) does it so it must be OK? cannot be allowed to undo good works.

</p>
<p>
Lots of similar talk abounds at the moment, with certainly some light in some of these areas showing through. Visit <a href="http://www.vivabit.com/bollocks/2006/02/09/rails-is-the-devil-in-your-client-side-shoulder">Dan</a> and <a href="http://domscripting.com/blog/display/49">Jeremy</a> for more.

      <p>
Well, yesterday was the long awaited <a href="http://carsonworkshops.com/summit">Carson Summit</a> which seemed to go pretty well all in all. Lots of <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/1087/">reviews</a> and <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2006/02/08/summit">notes</a> around at the moment but I’ll just throw a couple of my personal observations into the mix.

</p>
<p>
The presentation where all good, but nothing mindblowing. Most had something going for them; whether <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/">enthusiasm</a>, <a href="http://carsonworkshops.com">numbers</a> or a <a href="http://feedburner.com">special announcement</a>

</p>
<p>
I liked <a href="http://plasticbag.org">Tom Coates</a> diatribe about clean URLs, it something I’m fairly keen on too, I’m uming and arring over whether I too am a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/redux/97126279/">URL Fetishist</a>

</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://google.com">Google</a> vs <a href="http://yahoo.com">Yahoo</a> show was entertaining and interesting. Reading that Google tend to be more academic with Yahoo being a little bit more unhinged/entreprenurial is one thing – going to a conference where the guy from Google came across as something of a mad german professor with something of an <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=javascript">axe</a> to grind, compared to the Yahoo mob who ranged from a <a href="http://plasticbag.org">self confessed hippy</a> to <a href="http://www.iamcal.com/">Cal</a> and his three quarter length trousers. It’s appears all the rumours are true.

</p>
<p>
I did a couple of stints of SubEthaEdit collaborative note taking with <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2006/02/08/summit">Simon</a> which was fun and interesting at the same time. The <em>who’s going to write the next part</em> bit was quite amusing – at times writing the same things down, then everyone deleting them, then a pause.

</p>
<p>
The after show was, as always, good fun and fairly drunken. The pub was nice, but whomever suggested it on the wiki was playing a cruel joke. A conference with 800 geeks and a pub about 3 people wide at it’s widest point is not sensible. Neither was <a href="http://splintered.co.uk">Patrick’s</a> suggestion about not eating, but it all worked out in the end.

</p>
<p>
Was good to meet up with lots of people, both those <a href="http://htmldog.com">I</a> <a href="http://splintered.co.uk">had</a> <a href="http://www.thewatchmakerproject.com/">met</a> <a href="http://pixelicious.co.uk/">before</a> and those that <a href="http://cackhanded.net/">I hadn’t</a>. Hope to see everyone again soon, if not it will have to be <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2006">@media</a>.

Not so subtle hint in the subject line, but without further ado, Molly (yes, that <a href="http://molly.com">Molly</a>) is coming to Newcastle for a talk.

</p>
<p>
All the details are still being confirmed but we are talking:

</p>
<p>
<strong>15th February</strong>
Room 149 Northumberland Building, Northumbria University, City Campus, Newcastle, NE1 8ST
<strong>5-7pm</strong>

</p>
<p>
After talk drinks and food to be confirmed. Probably going to be along the lines of “Webstandards and Usability” with some time for a Q&A session as well.

</p>
<p>
Big up to <a href="http://tomsimcox.com">Tom Simcox</a> here. He’s been threatening for a while and with Molly in the country she’s agreed to come and visit little old us. Mark (of sunderland uni and NEUA fame) also sorted out the venue, amongst other things. Good job everyone.

</p>
<p>
We need people along for this so tell you employers, whoop to your colleagues, threaten you employees and be there.

</p>
<p>
I’ll post more details as they are confirmed. If your from outside the region and want to come along let me know. It’s short notice but sometimes these things are – and you know you dont want to miss out.

Of late I’ve found myself making quite a few smaller purchases of software. I’ve always been a fan of Open Source (and before that shareware – mainly on the ZX Spectrum) and still use lots of open source apps (anyone say Firefox) but for some really specific jobs it’s nice to have something you know is maybe a little more polished.

</p>
<p>
I dont know if it’s just me getting older and having more disposable income, or a greater appreciation of what it takes to make really good software (probably a bit of both) but it’s sort of snuck up on me? Anyone else finding the same? I know <a href="http://hicksdesign.co.uk">Jon</a> has been mentioning some <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/happy-old-man">cool new apps</a> he’s using. What about everyone else?

</p>
<p>
Recent purchase have included the following, nearly all bought with <a href="http://paypal.com">PayPal</a> as it happens:

</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/">Airfoil</a> allows any sounds (mainly music) to be send round the house to speakers connected to my AirPort. Lovely.

</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.nullriver.com/index/products/pspware">PSPWare</a> Like iSync but for my PSP. Also converts movies.

</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/radioshark/">radioShark</a> Ok, software and hardware but useful at times.

</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.haveamint.com">Mint</a> I’ve mentioned before. Lovely stats.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
I’m also evaluating (and at the moment being impressed by) a few other apps. Upcoming purchases probably.

</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://standalone.com/palmos/quick_news/">QuickNews</a> RSS reader (and podcasting app) for Palm OS.

</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.pocket-tunes.com/">PocketTunes</a> Good quality audio player for Palm OS, much better than the bundled Real Audio.

</li>
<li>
<a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> The missing editor for OS X? Maybe. It’s toying with me at the moment to sit aside <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">SubEthaEdit</a>

</li>
</ul>
<p>
On a blog related point, I’m aware I’ve been blogging more technology related stuff of late. I’ll be back with alot more web design and development banter soon, and some things happening up this neck of the woods (including a revamped <a href="http://newcastlenewmedia.org">newcastlenewmedia</a> site hopefully) – it’s a matter of having the ideas but not having the time! Hope it’s still all interesting to everyone.

I’m quite a <em>numbers</em> person and have something of a penchant for statistics As if you couldn’t guess from the site name. So it is with <a href="http://google.com">Google</a> (who also have a mathematical inspired site name). But unlike me they have more people (it’s just me) and lets face it, more computing power (only so many computers I can get in my house without getting told off).

</p>
<p>
So they bring us something of a <a href="http://code.google.com/webstats/index.html">large, automated, study</a> (including some decent analysis) of what markup is <em>actually</em> being used, interestingly also including common class names. I’d love to do something like that – over 1,000,000,000 sites analysed!

</p>
<p>
On a standards front seems to be good news and bad news, some of the common classes are things like:

</p>
<ul>
<li>
footer

</li>
<li>
menu

</li>
<li>
title, header, top

</li>
<li>
small, smalltext

</li>
<li>
text, content, main, body

</li>
<li>
nav

</li>
<li>
copyright

</li>
<li>
search

</li>
<li>
date

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Most of those I can see use for. They <strong>Mean</strong> something for a start. Although some of the other top entries included things such as:

</p>
<ul>
<li>
white

</li>
<li>
link

</li>
<li>
<del>
button</del>

</li>
<li>
style1 (my personal fave)

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Which maybe aren’t as well chosen.

</p>
<p>
On the other hand there are still lots of weirdness, proprietary tags and bizarre attributes. iWeb might be using crazy nested divs but <a href="http://kurafire.net/log/archive/2006/01/26/iweb-is-not-evil">it’s still valid</a>.

</p>
<p>
Being Google it’s all written fairly amusingly, including a few digs at competitors with applications which generate nightmare markup. Overall, a good read. There are probably a good number of other useful nuggets of information burried in the document as well. Anyone coming across anything of particular relevance leave a comment.
