I love this idea. It has a nice warm fuzzy feeling about it. <a href="http://www.molly.com/2006/06/27/web-professionals-code-of-ethics/">Molly was musing</a> about a code of ethics for <a href="http://www.molly.com/2005/11/14/web-standards-and-the-new-professionalism/">professional</a> web developers. Talk went on at <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2006">@media</a> about certification and education and the like, and the general concensus was pretty negative, for good reason in my opinion.

</p>
<p>
However, a code of ethics, more a stamement of intent from professional to professional, strikes me as a really good idea. It’s easy to forget that it can be difficult when learning (and aren’t we always learning in this job?) to really get down to best practice. It can be difficult to just do it at times, never mind do it <em>properly</em> what ever that means.

</p>
<p>
After reading on the comments I was feeling pretty good, and a few from the bottom I was thinking, I’ll set up a wiki, as suggested. Well, <a href="http://www.meriwilliams.com">Meri</a> got their first so good job Meri, it keeps it in Newcastle any how. <a href="http://www.meriwilliams.com/ethics/index.php?title=Main_Page">Head over there now</a>, it’s fairly light on content at the moment but I guess that is the point of this point.

</p>
<p>
What do other people think of this anyhow? Now I need to find some time. Or rather more time. I love being all enthusiastic, if only I found the time! I’m going to have to cut down on sleep, and I so like sleep.

<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/03/09/391362.aspx">Chris Wilson</a>, during his <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2006">@media</a> presentation mentioned in passing the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=D13EE10D-2718-47F1-AA86-1E32D526383D&#38;displaylang=en">IE 7 Readiness Toolkit</a>. This vaguely uninspiring title hides a very nice collection of essential tools for discerning web developers on Windows.

</p>
<p>
<a href="http://poisonedminds.com/comics/pm20060621.png">IE is painful</a> we already know that. We have a large number of tools available in Firefox to help us out, but sometimes you need to go to the source. Along with a nice <del>rip off</del> <ins>implementation</ins> of a web developer toolbar, it also put me onto <a href="http://www.fiddlertool.com/fiddler/">the Fiddler</a> (what is it about these names) which is an HTTP Debugging proxy. What? Well it sits next to IE and monitors all HTTP traffic, allowing you to find out exactly what’s going on. Very handy indeed, and worth running just to see what’s really going on, especially in Ajax land.

</p>
<p>
A couple of other interesting tools are included that I’ve not had a look at yet, the Expression Finder looks particularly interesting. It basically tracks down any hacks in your files and tells you off.

</p>
<p>
All in all a good move from Microsoft. What with <a href="http://opensearch.a9.com/">Open Search</a> being integrated into IE 7 as well, and RSS maybe reacing a tipping point eventually (Non geeks will believe my predictions one day) things might be looking up.

Yes folks. <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2006">@media 2006</a> is all over. Except for the year thing, everything else really was doubled. Double the people. Double the speakers. Double the number of chairs (no sitting on the floor this time!)

</p>
<p>
I made a list of a couple of things to make sure I did. Well how did I do?

</p>
<ul>
<li>
Take photos – Check. I’ll upload as I get a chance, but in the meantime their are already quite a few over on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/atmedia/">the atmedia flickr tag</a>

</li>
<li>
More SubEthaEdit note taking – With the problems with the wi-fi this was held to a single session on <a href="http://nascentguruism.com/files/events/atmedia-2006/20060615-1400-the-new-accessibility-guidelines-wcag-20.txt">WCAG 2.0</a> with <a href="http://nascentguruism.com">Steve</a> and <a href="http://ben-ward.co.uk">Ben</a>

</li>
<li>
Eat food (You know who IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m talking about) – Again score one. Some photos from a nice mexican place on the Thursday with <a href="http://thinkdrastic.net/">Olly</a> and <a href="http://www.liptrot.org">Adam</a>

</li>
<li>
Keep updating the syndicator thing – Again wi-fi problems but I did it each night anyhow. 38 new posts over the few days, and I need to add a few more sites. I do keep wondering about just using Technorati anyhow?

</li>
<li>
Watch the football (sorry, it is the World Cup) – I wont talk about that. Until I switched from drinking Corona to Asashi it was a little dull.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Apart from that I got up to the usual geekery. Met lots of people. Drank a few beers. Went to a few talks and panels.

</p>
<p>
I wandered around with a whole host of people. I’d try and name drop but I’d miss someone and make them feel bad. Well, ok, probably not but their you go.

</p>
<p>
The evening of the first night of the conference was particularly amusing. Wetherspoons for food, a short rant with <a href="http://quirksmode.org">PPK</a> and <a href="http://brothercake.co.uk">James</a> about (what else) Javascript and then spending the evening under the stars with <a href="http://splintered.co.uk">Patrick</a>, <a href="http://www.logohere.co.uk/blog/blog.htm">Andy</a> and a few others was, er, entertaining? slightly disturbing? bordering on stalking? All of those and more.

</p>
<p>
Their is simply too much to say and too little time. Which sort of explains the lack of details about the sessions and my take on them. I’ll probably post more about how I think the social side of things really is an integral part of these do’s, and how <a href="http://molly.com">Molly</a> really does deserve some sort of medal, and, well, you get the slighty hyper idea. And with my wi-fi hopefully working at home by now keep your readers peeled for both irreverant (sorry – irrelevant) banter and hopefully a couple of interesting insights and highlights.

</p>
<p>
More name dropping next time. Promise. Oh, and leave a comment if I said hi, it’s always a pleasure guys.

Right. It might have taken an overlong trip to London but I’ve finally got a spare moment <em>and</em> internet access. All back to normal hopefully soon. (mmmm)

</p>
<p>
Anyway… <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2006">@media</a>! It was ages ago, then some magical time warp type thing happened and it’s June all of a sudden. And I cant wait. Which is fairly handy as I’ll shortly be heading out to the pre show party to meet at least some people I know (or at least vaguely recognise from somewhere, once, maybe) and hopefully some new faces, always a solid part of the conferences I think.

</p>
<p>
Some of the things I want to do over the next couple of days, besides listen to alot of good stuff. (Rereading this I realised I just refered to Molly, Tantek, Jeffrey, Eric and everyone as <em>good stuff</em>. This is likely to be something of an understatement. No offence intended!)

</p>
<ul>
<li>
Take photos

</li>
<li>
More SubEthaEdit note taking

</li>
<li>
Eat food (You know who I’m <a href="http://cackhanded.net">talking</a> <a href="http://splintered.co.uk">about</a>)

</li>
<li>
Keep updating the syndicator thing

</li>
<li>
Watch the football (sorry, it is the World Cup)

</li>
</ul>
<p>
And I’ve no idea which sessions I’m going along to before you ask. I’m still pretending I can go to all of them to avoid the disapointment.

</p>
<p>
I’ve been doing all sorts of stuff I want to blog about; I’m doing a Masters type usability and testing certificate, playing with more PEAR, I’ve been having a play with <a href="http://codeigniter.com">Codeigniter</a> quite a bit as well, which is lovely (thanks <a href="http://thewatchmakerproject.com">Matt</a>) and have a couple more small apps in the oven. I also want to clean up a couple of olders ones (the mailing list, the feed syndicator, etc.) and still need to get round to writing a proper article. And that’s before @media, I dont want to thing how busy I’ll make myself after than once I get even more ideas.

</p>
<p>
Oh, and apologies for the <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/ical-schedule-for-media#comment">delay</a> in getting <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/ical/rp1ahkacn9nkhuqnjtihno34mg@group.calendar.google.com/public/basic">the calendar</a> updated. And I’ve no idea why some people couldn’t find it with the search tool. Anyway, updated now, so at least people shouldn’t get lost tomorrow.

I’m afraid you’ll have to bare with me at the moment. I’m busy, moving house, have no internet outside work (except open wi-fi points) and oh, did I mention I’m busy?

</p>
<p>
I have the usual raft of ideas, inability to really finish things unless I try and a dangerous penchant for playing with ever more scripting languages (<a href="http://media.wu-wien.ac.at/">XOTcl</a> anyone?).

</p>
<p>
Oh, the friends bit? Inspired by <a href="http://molly.com">Molly</a> and her incredible ability to be open about her life, I thought I’d say a huge <strong>Thank you</strong> to everyone who helped me move house this week. Much appreciated. It could have gone oh so wrong, but everyone chipping in meant everything worked out just fine.

I dont often just post links to things I find interesting. I try and warble on more about something or other that’s on my mind. However, being rather busy and coming across something that really stood out makes this here post different.

</p>
<p>
I stumbled upon <a href="dabbledb.com">DabbleDB</a> the other day. Watched the <a href="http://www.dabbledb.com/utr/">video</a>. Thought to my self “That’s pretty darn slick”.

</p>
<p>
DabbleDB is, pretty simply, an online database. For everyone. Ever. The blurb from the site says:

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Dabble DB combines the best of group spreadsheets, custom databases, and intranet web applications into a new way to manage and share your information on the web

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
What does that mean? It’s basically MS Access, but better and available through a web browser. Too complicated you say? Too hard to grasp? Watch the video. Be impressed.

</p>
<p>
One claim I’m interested in getting first hand experience of is the one regarding Spreadsheets. Most people use spreadsheets as light weight (ie. flimsy) databases, rather than the number crunching powerhouses they really are. DabbleDB seems an ideal replacement to the former, but what about the latter? I remeber seeing <a href="http://dean.edwards.name/">Dean Edwards’</a> playing with a <a href="http://dean.edwards.name/base/spreadsheet/">Javascript Spreadsheet</a> a while back.

</p>
<p>
I have to say I haven’t used DabbleDB yet. I haven’t signed up for a one month trial because I know I wouldn’t have time to explore properly just now. Everything that I’m excited about comes from the video, the site and the attached blog. When (not if) I get round to having a proper look I’ll try and remeber to post something.

</p>
<p>
Pretty much all your common desktop apps are <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/">now</a> <a href="http://www.campfirenow.com/">available</a> <a href="http://www.writely.com">through</a> <a href="http://calendar.google.com">a</a> <a href="http://gmail.com">browser</a>, except crazy things like image editing. Oh and the browser itself. Now their’s an idea. A meta browser. Within your browser window open up several smaller windows, maybe using different rendering engines or setups running remotely?

Tis about time for another meet up in sunny Newcastle. Pretty short notice but hey, the mailing list has called.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Thursday 25th of May</strong> it is

</p>
<p>
We are aiming for <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&#38;hl=en&#38;q=Pubs+in+NE1&#38;om=1&#38;latlng=54972784,-1612320,18338178544157676465">Tilly’s on Westgate road</a>. More info over on <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/78803/">Upcoming.org</a>

</p>
<p>
Already a good few people coming along so, if your in the general area, why not join us? If last time is anything to go by expect lots of people who either dont know each other or only know people by domain name discussing anything vaguely (and I do mean vaguely) related to the web.

</p>
<p>
The way of recognising everyone, as always, is the carrying of a recognisable web related book. Extra points for something really geeky, or really large.

</p>
<p>
I’m hoping for some good banter and some ideas for the future. Hey maybe even making these a regular shindig? It would save us taking ages to decide when and where to meet. Though on the where bit I pretty impressed. Their seems to be a strong correlation between web people in Newcastle and proper beer. Speaking of beer, I heard a rumour that <a href="http://swoo.co.uk">Steve</a> was buying a round to celebrate his new design.

At work we mainly use Microsoft technologies, .NET and such like, for our development. As I mentioned previously I’m playing with <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> at the moment, and getting on quite nicely. With .NET being a framework, aimed at allowing a variety of different languages to access the same class library, I though</p>

<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I wonder if you can use Python with the .NET framework?</p>

<p></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The rather large <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596000855/202-7885728-2282211">Programming Python</a> tome alludes to it being on the cards after the implementation of <a href="http://www.jython.org">Jython</a> but no more details than that.</p>

<p></p>
<p>
I came across a few dated references indicating that it was possible but, and mentioning very slow reference implementations, all of which didn’t bode too well. Then up popped <a href="http://ironpython.com/">IronPython</a> from an <a href="http://www.python.org/pycon/dc2004/papers/9/">article</a> by <a href="http://hugunin.net/">Jim Hugunin</a>. This looked like what I was looking for. But it looked unmaintained, the page not having been updated for a couple of years!</p>

<p></p>
<p>
But the story continued. Jim, having moved to Microsoft, was still working on IronPython and it looks like it’s moving forwards apace. The latest beta was released on the 20th of April and it looks like 4 more betas before a 1.0 release.</p>

<p></p>
<p>
This discovery makes Python appear even more interesting. A nicely designed, cross platform scripting language with full access to the might of the .NET framework and it’s own good looking web development framework in <a href="http://djangoproject.com">Django</a>.</p>

<p></p>
<p>
So, for anyone else looking around for similar details here’s a brief list of up to date information:</p>

<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
Video of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdntv/episode.aspx?xml=episodes/en/20051110PythonJH/manifest.xml">Jim showing IronPython off</a></p>

<li>

<p></li>
<li>
Good <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IronPython">WikiPedia entry</a></p>

<p></li>

I’m quite a fan of mobile devices. I’ve got a <a href="http://www.palm.com/">Palm</a>, I had a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1773120.stm">Pogo</a> for jeepers. However, I dont really have a geek phone at the moment (long story) – I’m still using my K700i.

</p>
<p>
While watching the last day of premiership football in a suitable venue I thought I might see about going to the cinema. With my trusty phone I <em>tried</em> to find what was going on. I waded through pages and pages. I did searches. It sent me round in circles more than once and I gave up more than once. I found some info. I tried to buy tickets. It failed to acknowledge the existence of first the cinema, and then the film.

</p>
<p>
Someone asked me at a recent talk about how easy it was to make sites compatible with mobile devices and I said (something like) “pretty easy”. I’m not happy with that answer now, so I’m going to change the question. How easy <em>should it</em> be to makes compatible sites?

</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/wap/wml_reference.asp">WML</a> might not be sexy, but it’s still in use all over the place. Support for mobile style sheets for proper web browsing seems all over the shop, with hundreds of different browsers pulling every which way.

</p>
<p>
Their are a host of IA issues that browsing on a mobile device brings up. A vast number of slightly new challenges to look at – and importantly a whole new way of confusing the user.

</p>
<p>
It makes you think maybe we need a dominant browser in the mobile space? Something to occupy alot of the ground and for the other browsers to loath and persue endlessly?

</p>
<p>
We also need some centres of best practice. I’m sure their are some out there. I just dont know where yet. Some references. A Mobile <a href="http://csszengarden.com">Zen Garden</a>. A good book or two to <a href="http://webdesignbookshelf.com">review</a>. Any thoughts?

Big thanks to <a href="http://mtpatto.com">Mathew Patterson</a> and <a href="http://theintranetblog.blogspot.com/">Nicola Dobiecka</a> for their assists here. Otherwise you would just be listening to my blatherings (a little like here then?)

</p>
<p>
Anyway, let me know what you think. As with all such endeavours more features (and probably fixes) will see the light of day over the next few weeks and months. Once everyone else is up I’ll post my personal faves, along with everyone one else ever.
