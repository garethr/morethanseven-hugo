        <a href="/2015/08/20/puppet-module-skeleton-updates/">Update to Puppet Module Skeleton</a>
      </h1>
      <span class="post-date">Aug 20, 2015 &middot; 2 minute read
      </span>
      
      <p>Being on holiday last week meant I had a little time for some gardening
of open source projects and I decided to update
<a href="https://www.github.com/garethr/puppet-module-skeleton">puppet-module-skeleton</a>
with some new opinions.</p>

<p>The skeleton is a replacement for the default module skeleton that ships
with Puppet and is used by puppet module generate. Unlike the default
skeleton this one is super-opinionated. It comes bundled with lots of
testing tools, suggestions for documentation, integration with <a href="http://travis-ci.org">Travis
CI</a>, module coverage reports and more.</p>

<p>Updates in the latest version include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Support for Puppet 4 paths</li>
<li>The addition of Rubocop, which enforces parts of the Ruby style guide</li>
<li>Adding a number of Puppet Lint plugins</li>
<li>Allow installing various Puppet versions during integration tests</li>
</ul>

<p>I also fixed a few reported bugs and extended the test matrix to test
across a range of Puppet and Ruby combinations.</p>

<p>The skeleton is intended to help people with a basic understanding of
Puppet write better modules, without having to setup everything
themselves. You don’t have to agree with all the options to make use of
the skeleton as it’s simple enough to delete a few files once you
generate your new module. But a working out-of-the-box beaker install,
and the ability to automatically run unit tests when files change are
patterns worth adopting for most module developers I think.</p>

<p>If anyone has any suggestions for extra tools, or changes to the
skeleton itself, let me know.</p>

<p>I read quite a bit (probably a book a week or so) and one of the topics
I&rsquo;ve been reading on for a while is information security. In a recent
conversation someone asked for some book suggestions, so I thought I&rsquo;d
write that up in a blog post rather than an email.</p>

<p>Most of this list isn&rsquo;t particularly technical. It&rsquo;s not a developers
list of software engineering tomes. If you&rsquo;re a developer or operator
then I&rsquo;d recommend reading some of the more policy or journalistic
pieces as well for context. And if you&rsquo;re just interested in the topic
but nor particularly technical I&rsquo;d skip the security engineering
suggestions.</p>

<p>Note that I make no claims about this being a particularly balanced
list, it&rsquo;s biased towards what I find interesting to read. Hopefully
you&rsquo;ll find it interesting too.</p>

<h2 id="journalism">Journalism</h2>

<p>Understanding why Information Security is important tends to require
some context. The following books provide that, with detailed real-world
stories of criminal and government activities.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Dark-Net-Jamie-Bartlett/dp/0434023159">The Dark Net</a> - Jamie Bartlett - an excellent personal tale of

</ul>

<h1 id="policy-and-context">Policy and context</h1>

<p>These books are focused more on government policy and nation state
threats, and the debate about the rules of war and the internet.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cyber-War-Threat-National-Security/dp/0061962244">Cyber War</a> - Richard Clarke - probably the best description of what
cyber war is and isn&rsquo;t, and some of the geopolitical problems
emerging.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cyber-War-Will-Take-Place/dp/1849042802">Cyber War Will Not Take Place</a> - Thomas Rid - a good counter to the
above book, with lots more detailed discussion of policy and definition.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Inside-Cyber-Warfare-Mapping-Underworld/dp/1449310044">Inside Cyber Warfare</a> - Jeffrey Carr - really just a run through of

      <span class="post-date">May 9, 2015 &middot; 2 minute read
      </span>
      
      

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty interested in <a href="http://openmirage.org/">MirageOS</a> at the
moment. Partly because I find the idea behind unikernels interesting and
partly because I keep bumping into the nice folks <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/ocamllabs/">OCaml
Labs</a> in Cambridge.</p>

<p>In order to write and build your MirageOS unikernel application you need
an OCaml development environment. Although this is
<a href="http://openmirage.org/wiki/install">documented</a> I wanted something a
little more repeatable. I also found and reported a few bugs in the
documentation which got me thinking about acceptance testing. I&rsquo;m not
(yet) an OCaml programmer, but infrastructure automation and testing I
can do.</p>

<h2 id="into-puppet">Into Puppet</h2>

<p>I started out writing a Puppet module to install and manage everything,
which is now available on
<a href="https://github.com/garethr/garethr-mirageos">GitHub</a> and on the
<a href="https://forge.puppetlabs.com/garethr/mirageos">Forge</a>.</p>

<p>This lets you do something like the following, and have a fully working
MirageOS setup on Ubuntu 12.04 or 14.04.</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span><span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">class</span> { <span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&#39;mirageos&#39;</span>:
  <span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">user</span>      =&gt; <span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&#39;vagrant&#39;</span>,
  <span style="color: #336699">opam_root</span> =&gt; <span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&#39;/home/vagrant/.opam&#39;</span>,
}
</pre></div>

<p>Given time, inclination or pull requests I&rsquo;ll add support for other
operating systems in the future.</p>

<h2 id="but-how-do-you-know-it-works">But how do you know it works?</h2>

<p>The module has a small unit test suite, but it&rsquo;s nice to know test the
actual running of Puppet and installation of the software. For this I&rsquo;ve
used <a href="http://kitchen.ci/">Test Kitchen</a> and
<a href="http://serverspec.org/">ServerSpec</a>. This allows for spinning up 2
virtual machines (one for each supported operating system), applying the
Puppet manifest and then making some assertions:</p>

<script src="//gist.github.com/garethr/a8d090b5d7f7a190f7d9.js"></script>

<p>The above is simply checking whether certain packages are installed, the
PPA is setup correctly and whether <code>mirage</code> and <code>opam</code> can be executed
cleanly.</p>

<h2 id="can-it-produce-a-working-unikernel">Can it produce a working unikernel?</h2>

<p>The above tells us whether the installation worked, but not whether the
resulting software allows us to build MirageOS unikernels. For this I
used <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/bats">Bats</a> running in the same
Test Kitchen setup.</p>

<script src="//gist.github.com/garethr/191c4c0676b471f9b986.js"></script>

<p>The above configures and builds a simple HTTP server unikernel, and then
checks that when run it returns the expected response on the correct
port.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I like the separation of concerns above. I can use the Puppet code
without the test code, or even swap the Puppet code out for a shell
script if I wanted. I could also run the serverspec tests anywhere I
want to check state, which is the reason for separating those tests from
the one&rsquo;s building and running a unikernel. Overall the tool chain for ad-hoc
infrastructure testing (quick mention of
<a href="http://infrataster.net/">Infrataster</a> too) is really quite powerful and
approachable. I&rsquo;d love to see more software ship with a user-facing test
suite for people to verify their installation works.</p>

      <p>My job at Puppet Labs has given me an excuse to take a closer look at
the advancements in Windows automation, in particular <a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a>
and <a href="http://boxstarter.org/">BoxStarter</a>. The following is very much a work
in progress but it&rsquo;s hopefully useful for a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>If like me you&rsquo;ve mainly been doing non-Windows development for a
while it&rsquo;s interesting to see what is possible</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re starting out with infrastructure development on Windows the
following could be a good starting place</li>
<li>if you&rsquo;re an experienced Windows pro then you can let me know of any
improvements</li>
</ul>

<p>All that&rsquo;s needed is to run the following from a CMD or Powershell
prompt on a new Windows machine (you can also visit the URL in Internet
Explorer if you prefer).</p>

<pre><code>START http://boxstarter.org/package/nr/url?https://gist.githubusercontent.com/garethr/a1838aa68355a0766de4/raw/d92b41ee9dcad68c079d24c64bac7d1d27cf37c7/garethr.ps1
</code></pre>

<p>This launches BoxStarter, which executes the following code:</p>

<script src="//gist.github.com/garethr/a1838aa68355a0766de4.js"></script>

<p>This takes a while as it runs Windows update and repeatedly reboots the
machine. But once completed you&rsquo;ll have the listed software installed
and configured on a newly up-to-date Windows machine.</p>

        <a href="/2014/10/28/docker-puppet-shared-volumes/">Docker, Puppet and shared volumes</a>
      </h1>
      <span class="post-date">Oct 28, 2014 &middot; 4 minute read
      </span>
      
      

<p>During one of the openspace sessions at Devopsdays we talked about docker and configuration management,
and one of the things we touched on was using dockers shared volumes support. This is easier to explain
with an example.</p>

<p>First, lets create a docker image to run puppet. I&rsquo;m also installing r10k for managing third party
modules.</p>

<h2 id="docker">Docker</h2>

<pre><code>FROM ubuntu:trusty

RUN apt-get update -q
RUN apt-get install -qy wget
RUN wget http://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-trusty.deb
RUN dpkg -i puppetlabs-release-trusty.deb
RUN apt-get update

RUN apt-get install -y puppet ruby1.9.3 build-essential git-core
RUN echo &quot;gem: --no-ri --no-rdoc&quot; &gt; ~/.gemrc
RUN gem install r10k
</code></pre>

<p>Lets build that and tag it locally. Feel free to use whatever name you like here.</p>

<pre><code>docker build -t garethr/puppet .
</code></pre>

<p>Lets now use that image as a base for another image.</p>

<pre><code>FROM garethr/puppet

RUN mkdir /etc/shared
ADD Puppetfile /
RUN r10k puppetfile check
RUN r10k puppetfile install
ADD init.pp /
CMD [&quot;puppet&quot;, &quot;apply&quot;, &quot;--modulepath=/modules&quot;, &quot;/init.pp&quot;,&quot;--verbose&quot;, &quot;--show_diff&quot;]
</code></pre>

<p>This image will be used to create containers that we intend to run. Here we&rsquo;re including a
Puppetfile (a list of module dependencies) and then running r10k to download those dependencies.
Finally we add a simple puppetfile (this would likely be an entire manifests directory in most cases).
The final line means that when we run a container based on this image it will run puppet and then exit.</p>

<p>Again lets build the image and tag it.</p>

<pre><code>docker build -t garethr/puppetshared .
</code></pre>

<p>Just as a demo, here&rsquo;s a sample <code>Puppetfile</code> which includes the puppetlabs stdlib module.</p>

<h2 id="puppet">Puppet</h2>

<pre><code>mod 'puppetlabs/stdlib'
</code></pre>

<p>And again as an example here&rsquo;s a simple puppet <code>init.pp</code> file. All we&rsquo;re doing is creating a file
at a specific location.</p>

<pre><code>file { '/etc/shared/client':
  ensure =&gt; directory,
}

file { '/etc/shared/client/apache.conf':
  ensure  =&gt; present,
  content =&gt; &quot;not a real config file&quot;,
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="fig">Fig</h2>

<p><a href="http://fig.sh">Fig</a> is a tool to declare container types in a text file, and then run and manage
them from a simple CLI. We could do all this with straigh docker calls too.</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span>master:
  image: garethr/puppetshared
  volumes:
    - /etc/shared:/etc/shared:rw

client:
  image: ubuntu:trusty
  volumes:
    - /etc/shared/client:/etc/:ro
  command: <span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&#39;/bin/sh</span><span style="color: #336699"> </span><span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">-c</span><span style="color: #336699"> </span><span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;while</span><span style="color: #336699"> </span><span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">true;</span><span style="color: #336699"> </span><span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">do</span><span style="color: #336699"> </span><span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">echo</span><span style="color: #336699"> </span><span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">hello</span><span style="color: #336699"> </span><span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">world;</span><span style="color: #336699"> </span><span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">sleep</span><span style="color: #336699"> </span><span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">1;</span><span style="color: #336699"> </span><span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">done&quot;&#39;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The important part of the above is the volumes lines. What we&rsquo;re doing here is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sharing the <code>/etc/shared</code> directory on the host with the container called master. The container will be able to write to the host filesystem.</li>
<li>Sharing a subdirectory of of <code>/etc/shared</code> with the client container. The client can only read this information.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note the client container here isn&rsquo;t running Puppet. Here it&rsquo;s just running sleep in a loop to simulate a long running process like
your custom application.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s run the master. Note that this will run puppet and then exit. But with the above manifest it will create
a config file on the host.</p>

<pre><code>fig run master
</code></pre>

<p>Then run the client. This won&rsquo;t exit and should just print <code>hello world</code> to stdout.</p>

<pre><code>fig run client
</code></pre>

<p>Docker 1.3 adds the handy exec command, which allows for one-off commands to be executed within a running container.
Lets use that to see our new config file.</p>

<pre><code>docker exec puppetshared_client_run_1 cat /etc/apache.conf
</code></pre>

<p>This should output the contents of the file we created by running the master container.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>This is obviously a very simple example but I think it&rsquo;s interesting for a few reasons.</p>

<ul>
<li>We have completely separated our code (in the container) from the configuration</li>
<li>We get to use familiar tools for managing the configuration in a familiar way</li>
</ul>

<p>It also raises a few problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>The host needs to know what types of container are going to run on it, in order to have the correct configuration. If you&rsquo;re using <a href="https://forge.puppetlabs.com/garethr/docker">Puppet module</a> then this is simple enough to solve.</li>
<li>The host ends up with all of the configuration for all the containers in one place, you could also do things with encrypting the data and having the relevant keys in one image and not others. Given how if you&rsquo;re on the host you own the container anyway this isn&rsquo;t as odd as it sounds.</li>
<li>We&rsquo;re just demonstrating files here, but if we change our manifest and rerun the puppet container then we change the config files. But depending on the application it  won&rsquo;t pick that up unless we restart it or create a new container.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given enough time I may try build a reference implementation using this approach, anyone with ideas about that let me know.</p>

      <p>I like the central idea behind storing configuration in something like
<a href="https://github.com/coreos/etcd">Etcd</a> rather than lots of files on lots
of disks, but a few challenges still remain. Things that spring to mind
are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are all your passwords now available to all of your nodes?</li>
<li>How do I know when configuration changed and who changed it?</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;ll leave the first of those for today (although have a look at
<a href="http://www.conjur.net/">Conjur</a> as one approach to this). For the second,
I&rsquo;m quite fond of plain text, pull requests and a well tested deployment
pipeline. Before Etcd (or <a href="http://www.consul.io/">Consul</a> or similar) you
would probably have values in Hiera or Data Bags or similar and inject them
into files on hosts using your configuration management tool of choice. So
lets just do the same with our new-fangled distributed configuration store.</p>

<p>Say you wanted to switch over to using Consul instead? Just switch the provider.</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span><span style="color: #336699">key_value_config</span> { <span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&#39;/foo&#39;</span>:

  <span style="color: #336699">provider</span> =&gt; <span style="color: #336699">consul</span>,
  <span style="color: #336699">value</span>    =&gt; <span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&#39;bar&#39;</span>,
}
</pre></div>

<p>You&rsquo;d probably move all of that out into something like hiera, and then generate
the above resources, but you get the idea.</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span>etcd_values:
  foo: bar
</pre></div>

<p>The above is implemented in a very simple
<a href="https://github.com/garethr/garethr-key_value_config">proof of concept Puppet module</a>.
Anyone with any feedback please do let me know.</p>

      </h1>
      <span class="post-date">Jul 20, 2014 &middot; 2 minute read

      <p><em>The following is the email I sent to lots of my colleagues at the
<a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/">Government Digital Service</a> last week.</em></p>

<p>So, after 3 rather exciting years I&rsquo;ve decided to leave GDS.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s surprisingly difficult to write if I&rsquo;m honest.</p>

<p>I was part of the team that built and shipped the beta of <a href="https://www.gov.uk">GOV.UK</a>.
Since then I&rsquo;ve worked across half of what has become GDS, equally
helping and frustrating (then hopefully helping) lots of you. I&rsquo;ve
done a great deal and learnt even more, as well as collected arcane
knowledge about government infosec and the dark arts of procurement
along the way. I&rsquo;ve done, and helped others do, work I wouldn&rsquo;t even
have thought possible (or maybe likely is the right word?) when I
started.</p>

<p>So why leave? For all the other things I do I&rsquo;m basically a tool
builder. So I&rsquo;m going off to work for <a href="http://puppetlabs.com">Puppet Labs</a> to build
infrastructure tools that don&rsquo;t suck. That sort of pretty specific
work is something that <em>should</em> be done outside government in my
opinion. I&rsquo;m a pretty firm believer in &ldquo;government should only do what
only government can do&rdquo; (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/design-principles#second">design principle number 2</a> for those that
haven&rsquo;t memorised them yet). And if I&rsquo;m honest, focusing on something
smaller than fixing a country&rsquo;s civic infrastructure is appealing for
now.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll let you in on a secret; I didn&rsquo;t join what became GDS because of
the GOV.UK project. I joined to work with friends I&rsquo;d not yet had the
chance to work with and to see the inside of a growing organisation
from the start. I remember <a href="http://twitter.com/tomskitomski">Tom Loosemore</a> promising me we&rsquo;d be 200
people in 3 years! As far as anyone knows we&rsquo;re 650+ people. That&rsquo;s
about a person a day for 2 years. I&rsquo;m absolutely not saying that came
without a cost, but for me being part of that that was part of the
point - so I can be a little accepting with hindsight.</p>

<p>For me, apart from all the short term things (side-note: this job now
has me thinking £10million is a small amount of money and 2 years is a
small amount of time) there is one big mission:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Make government a sustainable part of the UK tech community</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That means in 10 years time experienced tech people from across the
country, as well as people straight from university, choosing to work
for government. Not just for some abstract and personal reason (though
that&rsquo;s fine too), but because it&rsquo;s a a genuinely interesting place to
work. That one&rsquo;s on us.</p>

      <span class="post-date">Jun 23, 2014 &middot; 2 minute read
      </span>
      
      <p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project">OWASP ZAP</a> or
the Zed Attack Proxy. It&rsquo;s suprisingly user friendly and nicely pulls of
it&rsquo;s aim of being useful to developers as well as more hardcore penetration testers.</p>

<p>One of the features I&rsquo;m particularly fond of is the aforementioned
proxy. Basically it can act as a transparent HTTP proxy, recording the
traffic, and then analyse that to conduct various active security tests;
looking for XSS issues or directory traversal vulnerabilities for
instance. The simplest way of seeding the ZAP with something to analyse is using
the simple inbuilt spider.</p>

<p>So far, so good. Unfortunately ZAP isn&rsquo;t designed to be used from the
command line. It&rsquo;s either a thick client, or it&rsquo;s a proxy with a simple
API. Enter <a href="https://github.com/garethr/zapr">Zapr</a>.</p>

<p>Zapr is a pretty simple wrapper around the ZAP API (using the
<a href="https://github.com/vpereira/owasp_zap">owasp_zap</a> library under the
hood). All it does is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Launch the proxy in headless mode</li>
<li>Trigger the spider</li>
<li>Launch various attacks against the collected URLs</li>
<li>Print out the results</li>
</ul>

<p>This is fairly limited, in that a spider isn&rsquo;t going to work
particularly well for a mor interactive application, but it&rsquo;s a farily good
starting point. I may add different seed methods in the future (or would
happily accept pull requests). Usage wise it&rsquo;s as simple as:</p>

<pre><code>zapr --summary http://localhost:3000/
</code></pre>

<p>That will print you out something like the following, assuming it finds
an issue.</p>

<pre><code>+-----------------------------------+----------+----------------------------------------+
| Alert                             | Risk     | URL                                    |
+-----------------------------------+----------+----------------------------------------+
| Cross Site Scripting (Reflected)  | High     |http://localhost:3000/forgot_password   |
+-----------------------------------+----------+----------------------------------------+
</code></pre>

<p>The above alert is taken from a <a href="https://github.com/garethr/zapr-example">simple example</a>,
using the <a href="https://github.com/OWASP/railsgoat">RailsGoat</a> vulnerable web
application as a scape goat. You can see the resulting output from
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/garethr/zapr-example">Travis running the tests</a>.</p>

<p>Zapr is a bit of a proof of concept so it&rsquo;s not particularly robust or
well tested. Depending on usage and interest I may tidy it up and extend
it, or I may leave it as a useful experiment and try and finally get ZAP
support into <a href="http://gauntlt.org">Gauntlt</a>, only time will tell.</p>

      </h1>
      <span class="post-date">Apr 25, 2014 &middot; 2 minute read
      </span>
      
      

<p>While at <a href="http://craft-conf.com/2014">Craft</a> I decided to have a quick look at
<a href="http://www.consul.io/">Consul</a>, a new service discovery framework with
a few intersting features. One of the main selling points is a DNS
interface with a nice API. The <a href="http://www.consul.io/intro/index.html">Introduction</a>
shows how to use this via the dig command line tool, but how do you use
a custom internal DNS server without modifying all your applications?
One answer to this question is
<a href="http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html">Dnsmasq</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not explaining Consul here, the above mentioned introduction does a
good job of stepping through the setup. The following assumes you have
installed and started consul.</p>

<h2 id="installation-and-configuration">Installation and configuration</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m running these examples on an Ubuntu 14.04 machine, but dnsmasq
should be available and packaged for lots of different operating
systems.</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span>apt-get install dnsmasq
</pre></div>

<p>Once installed we can create a very simple configuration.</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span><span style="color: #003388">echo</span> <span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;server=/consul/127.0.0.1#8600&quot;</span> &gt; /etc/dnsmasq.d/10-consul
</pre></div>

<p>All we&rsquo;re doing here is specifying that DNS requests for consul services
are to be dealt with by the DNS server at 127.0.0.1 on port 8600. Unless
you&rsquo;ve changed the consul defaults this should work.</p>

<p>Just in case you prefer Puppet their is already a handy
<a href="https://github.com/saz/puppet-dnsmasq">dnsmasq</a> module. The resulting
puppet code then looks like this.</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span><span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">include</span> <span style="color: #336699">dnsmasq</span>
<span style="color: #336699">dnsmasq</span>::<span style="color: #336699">conf</span> { <span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&#39;consul&#39;</span>:
  <span style="color: #336699">ensure</span>  =&gt; <span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">present</span>,
  <span style="color: #336699">content</span> =&gt; <span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&#39;server=/consul/127.0.0.1#8600&#39;</span>,
}
</pre></div>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>The examples from the main documentation specify a custom DNS server for
dig like so:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span>dig @127.0.0.1 -p <span style="color: #0000DD; font-weight: bold">8600</span> web.service.consul
</pre></div>

<p>With Dnsmasq installed and configured as above you should just be able
to do the following:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span>dig web.service.consul
</pre></div>

<p>And now any of your existing applications will be able to use your
consul instance for service discovery via DNS.</p>

        <a href="/2014/03/15/testing-vagrant-runs-with-cucumber/">Testing Vagrant runs with Cucumber</a>
      </h1>
      <span class="post-date">Mar 15, 2014 &middot; 2 minute read
      </span>
      
      <p>I&rsquo;ve been a big fan of <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> since it&rsquo;s
initial release and still find myself using it for various tasks.</p>

<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been using it to test collections of Puppet modules. For a
single host
<a href="https://github.com/jvoorhis/vagrant-serverspec">vagrant-serverspec</a> is
excellent. Simply install the plugin, add a provisioner and write your
<a href="http://serverspec.org/">serverspec</a> tests. The serverspec provisioner
looks like the following:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span>config.vm.provision <span style="color: #aa6600; background-color: #fff0f0">:serverspec</span> <span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">do</span> |spec|
  spec.pattern = <span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&#39;*_spec.rb&#39;</span>
<span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">end</span>
</pre></div>

<p>But I also found myself wanting to test behaviour from the host
(serverspec tests are run on the guest), and also wanted to write tests
that checked the behaviour of a multi-box setup. I started by simply
writing some <a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a> tests which I ran locally,
but I decided I wanted this integrated with vagrant. Enter
<a href="https://github.com/garethr/vagrant-cucumber-host">vagrant-cucumber-host</a>.
This implements a new vagrant provisioner which runs a set of cucumber
features locally.</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span>config.vm.provision <span style="color: #aa6600; background-color: #fff0f0">:cucumber</span> <span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">do</span> |cucumber|
  cucumber.features = []
<span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">end</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Just drop your features in the features folder and run <code>vagrant
provision</code>. If you just want to run the cucumber features, without any
of the other provisioners running you can use:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span>vagrant provision --provision-with cucumber
</pre></div>

<p>Another advantage of writing this as a vagrant plugin is that it uses
the Ruby bundled with vagrant, meaning you just install the plugin
rather than faff about with a local Ruby install.</p>

<p>A couple of other vagrant plugins that I&rsquo;ve used to make the testing
setup easier are <a href="https://github.com/cogitatio/vagrant-hostsupdater">vagrant-hostsupdater</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/adrienthebo/vagrant-hosts">vagrant-hosts</a>. Both
help with managing hosts files, which makes writing tests without
knowing the IP addresses easier.</p>
