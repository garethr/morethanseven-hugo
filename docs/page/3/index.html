      </h1>
      <span class="post-date">Jul 20, 2014 &middot; 2 minute read
      </span>
      
      <p><em>The following is the email I sent to lots of my colleagues at the
<a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/">Government Digital Service</a> last week.</em></p>

<p>So, after 3 rather exciting years I&rsquo;ve decided to leave GDS.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s surprisingly difficult to write if I&rsquo;m honest.</p>

<p>I was part of the team that built and shipped the beta of <a href="https://www.gov.uk">GOV.UK</a>.
Since then I&rsquo;ve worked across half of what has become GDS, equally
helping and frustrating (then hopefully helping) lots of you. I&rsquo;ve
done a great deal and learnt even more, as well as collected arcane
knowledge about government infosec and the dark arts of procurement
along the way. I&rsquo;ve done, and helped others do, work I wouldn&rsquo;t even
have thought possible (or maybe likely is the right word?) when I
started.</p>

<p>So why leave? For all the other things I do I&rsquo;m basically a tool
builder. So I&rsquo;m going off to work for <a href="http://puppetlabs.com">Puppet Labs</a> to build
infrastructure tools that don&rsquo;t suck. That sort of pretty specific
work is something that <em>should</em> be done outside government in my
opinion. I&rsquo;m a pretty firm believer in &ldquo;government should only do what
only government can do&rdquo; (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/design-principles#second">design principle number 2</a> for those that
haven&rsquo;t memorised them yet). And if I&rsquo;m honest, focusing on something
smaller than fixing a country&rsquo;s civic infrastructure is appealing for
now.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll let you in on a secret; I didn&rsquo;t join what became GDS because of
the GOV.UK project. I joined to work with friends I&rsquo;d not yet had the
chance to work with and to see the inside of a growing organisation
from the start. I remember <a href="http://twitter.com/tomskitomski">Tom Loosemore</a> promising me we&rsquo;d be 200
people in 3 years! As far as anyone knows we&rsquo;re 650+ people. That&rsquo;s
about a person a day for 2 years. I&rsquo;m absolutely not saying that came
without a cost, but for me being part of that that was part of the
point - so I can be a little accepting with hindsight.</p>

<p>For me, apart from all the short term things (side-note: this job now
has me thinking Â£10million is a small amount of money and 2 years is a
small amount of time) there is one big mission:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Make government a sustainable part of the UK tech community</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That means in 10 years time experienced tech people from across the
country, as well as people straight from university, choosing to work
for government. Not just for some abstract and personal reason (though
that&rsquo;s fine too), but because it&rsquo;s a a genuinely interesting place to
work. That one&rsquo;s on us.</p>

      </h1>
      <span class="post-date">Jun 23, 2014 &middot; 2 minute read
      </span>
      
      <p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project">OWASP ZAP</a> or
the Zed Attack Proxy. It&rsquo;s suprisingly user friendly and nicely pulls of
it&rsquo;s aim of being useful to developers as well as more hardcore penetration testers.</p>

<p>One of the features I&rsquo;m particularly fond of is the aforementioned
proxy. Basically it can act as a transparent HTTP proxy, recording the
traffic, and then analyse that to conduct various active security tests;
looking for XSS issues or directory traversal vulnerabilities for
instance. The simplest way of seeding the ZAP with something to analyse is using
the simple inbuilt spider.</p>

<p>So far, so good. Unfortunately ZAP isn&rsquo;t designed to be used from the
command line. It&rsquo;s either a thick client, or it&rsquo;s a proxy with a simple
API. Enter <a href="https://github.com/garethr/zapr">Zapr</a>.</p>

<p>Zapr is a pretty simple wrapper around the ZAP API (using the
<a href="https://github.com/vpereira/owasp_zap">owasp_zap</a> library under the
hood). All it does is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Launch the proxy in headless mode</li>
<li>Trigger the spider</li>
<li>Launch various attacks against the collected URLs</li>
<li>Print out the results</li>
</ul>

<p>This is fairly limited, in that a spider isn&rsquo;t going to work
particularly well for a mor interactive application, but it&rsquo;s a farily good
starting point. I may add different seed methods in the future (or would
happily accept pull requests). Usage wise it&rsquo;s as simple as:</p>

<pre><code>zapr --summary http://localhost:3000/
</code></pre>

<p>That will print you out something like the following, assuming it finds
an issue.</p>

<pre><code>+-----------------------------------+----------+----------------------------------------+
| Alert                             | Risk     | URL                                    |
+-----------------------------------+----------+----------------------------------------+
| Cross Site Scripting (Reflected)  | High     |http://localhost:3000/forgot_password   |
+-----------------------------------+----------+----------------------------------------+
</code></pre>

<p>The above alert is taken from a <a href="https://github.com/garethr/zapr-example">simple example</a>,
using the <a href="https://github.com/OWASP/railsgoat">RailsGoat</a> vulnerable web
application as a scape goat. You can see the resulting output from
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/garethr/zapr-example">Travis running the tests</a>.</p>

<p>Zapr is a bit of a proof of concept so it&rsquo;s not particularly robust or
well tested. Depending on usage and interest I may tidy it up and extend
it, or I may leave it as a useful experiment and try and finally get ZAP
support into <a href="http://gauntlt.org">Gauntlt</a>, only time will tell.</p>

        <a href="/2014/04/25/consul/">Consul, DNS and Dnsmasq</a>
      </h1>
      <span class="post-date">Apr 25, 2014 &middot; 2 minute read
      </span>
      
      

<p>While at <a href="http://craft-conf.com/2014">Craft</a> I decided to have a quick look at
<a href="http://www.consul.io/">Consul</a>, a new service discovery framework with
a few intersting features. One of the main selling points is a DNS
interface with a nice API. The <a href="http://www.consul.io/intro/index.html">Introduction</a>
shows how to use this via the dig command line tool, but how do you use
a custom internal DNS server without modifying all your applications?
One answer to this question is
<a href="http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html">Dnsmasq</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not explaining Consul here, the above mentioned introduction does a
good job of stepping through the setup. The following assumes you have
installed and started consul.</p>

<h2 id="installation-and-configuration">Installation and configuration</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m running these examples on an Ubuntu 14.04 machine, but dnsmasq
should be available and packaged for lots of different operating
systems.</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span>apt-get install dnsmasq
</pre></div>

<p>Once installed we can create a very simple configuration.</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span><span style="color: #003388">echo</span> <span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;server=/consul/127.0.0.1#8600&quot;</span> &gt; /etc/dnsmasq.d/10-consul
</pre></div>

<p>All we&rsquo;re doing here is specifying that DNS requests for consul services
are to be dealt with by the DNS server at 127.0.0.1 on port 8600. Unless
you&rsquo;ve changed the consul defaults this should work.</p>

<p>Just in case you prefer Puppet their is already a handy
<a href="https://github.com/saz/puppet-dnsmasq">dnsmasq</a> module. The resulting
puppet code then looks like this.</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span><span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">include</span> <span style="color: #336699">dnsmasq</span>
<span style="color: #336699">dnsmasq</span>::<span style="color: #336699">conf</span> { <span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&#39;consul&#39;</span>:
  <span style="color: #336699">ensure</span>  =&gt; <span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">present</span>,
  <span style="color: #336699">content</span> =&gt; <span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&#39;server=/consul/127.0.0.1#8600&#39;</span>,
}
</pre></div>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>The examples from the main documentation specify a custom DNS server for
dig like so:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span>dig @127.0.0.1 -p <span style="color: #0000DD; font-weight: bold">8600</span> web.service.consul
</pre></div>

<p>With Dnsmasq installed and configured as above you should just be able
to do the following:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span>dig web.service.consul
</pre></div>

<p>And now any of your existing applications will be able to use your
consul instance for service discovery via DNS.</p>

        <a href="/2014/03/15/testing-vagrant-runs-with-cucumber/">Testing Vagrant runs with Cucumber</a>
      </h1>
      <span class="post-date">Mar 15, 2014 &middot; 2 minute read
      </span>
      
      <p>I&rsquo;ve been a big fan of <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> since it&rsquo;s
initial release and still find myself using it for various tasks.</p>

<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been using it to test collections of Puppet modules. For a
single host
<a href="https://github.com/jvoorhis/vagrant-serverspec">vagrant-serverspec</a> is
excellent. Simply install the plugin, add a provisioner and write your
<a href="http://serverspec.org/">serverspec</a> tests. The serverspec provisioner
looks like the following:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span>config.vm.provision <span style="color: #aa6600; background-color: #fff0f0">:serverspec</span> <span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">do</span> |spec|
  spec.pattern = <span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&#39;*_spec.rb&#39;</span>
<span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">end</span>
</pre></div>

<p>But I also found myself wanting to test behaviour from the host
(serverspec tests are run on the guest), and also wanted to write tests
that checked the behaviour of a multi-box setup. I started by simply
writing some <a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a> tests which I ran locally,
but I decided I wanted this integrated with vagrant. Enter
<a href="https://github.com/garethr/vagrant-cucumber-host">vagrant-cucumber-host</a>.
This implements a new vagrant provisioner which runs a set of cucumber
features locally.</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span>config.vm.provision <span style="color: #aa6600; background-color: #fff0f0">:cucumber</span> <span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">do</span> |cucumber|
  cucumber.features = []
<span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">end</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Just drop your features in the features folder and run <code>vagrant
provision</code>. If you just want to run the cucumber features, without any
of the other provisioners running you can use:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span>vagrant provision --provision-with cucumber
</pre></div>

<p>Another advantage of writing this as a vagrant plugin is that it uses
the Ruby bundled with vagrant, meaning you just install the plugin
rather than faff about with a local Ruby install.</p>

<p>A couple of other vagrant plugins that I&rsquo;ve used to make the testing
setup easier are <a href="https://github.com/cogitatio/vagrant-hostsupdater">vagrant-hostsupdater</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/adrienthebo/vagrant-hosts">vagrant-hosts</a>. Both
help with managing hosts files, which makes writing tests without
knowing the IP addresses easier.</p>

      <span class="post-date">Feb 16, 2014 &middot; 5 minute read

<p>At the excellent <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog/2014/feb/15/london-devops-meetup-held-at-the-guardian">London Devops meetup</a> last week I asked what was
apparently a controversial question:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>should you just use software as a service monitoring products rather than integrate lots of open source tools?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This got a few people worked up and I promised a blog post.</p>

<p>Note that I wrote a post listing lots of <a href="http://www.morethanseven.net/2013/10/13/looking-into-monitoring-and-logging-tools/">open source monitoring tools</a>
not that long ago. And I&rsquo;ve been to both the
<a href="http://monitorama.com/">Monitorama</a> events about open source
monitoring. And have a bunch of <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/garethr?q=monitoring">Puppet modules for open source monitoring tools</a>. I&rsquo;m
a fan of both open source and of open source monitoring. Please don&rsquo;t
read this as an attack on either, and particularly on the work of
awesome people working on  great open source monitoring products.</p>

<h2 id="some-assumptions">Some assumptions</h2>

<ol>
<li>No one product exists that does everything. I think this is true for
SaaS as much as for open source.</li>
<li>Lets work with about 200 hosts. This is a somewhat arbitrary number I
know, some people will have more and others less.</li>
<li>If it saves money we&rsquo;ll pay yearly, rather than monthly or hourly.</li>
<li>We could probably get some volume discounts from some of the
suppliers, but we&rsquo;ll use list prices for this post.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="show-me-the-money">Show me the money</h2>

<p>So what would it cost to get up and running with a state of the art
software as a service monitoring system? In order to do this we need to
choose our software. For this post that means I&rsquo;m going to pick products
I&rsquo;ve used (sometimes only a bit) and like. This isn&rsquo;t a comprehensive
study of all the alternatives I&rsquo;m afraid - though feel free to write
your own alternative blog posts.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a> provides a crazy amount of data about
the running of both your servers and your applications. This includes
application performance data, errors, low level metrics and even rolled
up method or database query performance. $149 per host per month for our
200 hosts gives us <em>$29,800</em> per month.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://metrics.librato.com">Librato Metrics</a> provides a fantastic way
of storing arbitrary time series data. We&rsquo;re already storing lots of
data in New Relic but Metrics provides us with less opinionated software
so we can use it for anything, for instance number of logins or searches
or other business level metrics. We&rsquo;ll go for a plan with 200 data sources, 100 metrics each and at 10 second resolution for a cost of <em>$3,860</em> per month.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.pagerduty.com/">Pagerduty</a> is all about the alerts side of
monitoring. Most of the other SaaS tools we&rsquo;ve chosen integrate with it
so we can make sure we get actionable emails and SMS messages to the
right people at the right time. Our plan costs $18 per person per month,
so lets say we have 30 people at a cost of <em>$540</em> per month.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://papertrailapp.com/">Papertrail</a> is all about logs. Simple setup
your servers with syslog and Papertrail will collect, analyze and store
all your log messages. You get a browser based interface, search tools
and the ability to setup alerts. We like lots of logs so we&rsquo;ll have a
plan for 2 weeks of search, 1 year archive and 100GB month of log
traffic. That all costs <em>$575</em> per month.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://www.getsentry.com">Sentry</a> is all about exceptions. We could be
simply logging these and sending them to Papertrail but Sentry provides
tools for tracking and rolling up occurences. We&rsquo;ll go for a plan with
90 days of history and 200 events per minute at a cost of <em>$199</em> a
month.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://www.pingdom.com">Pingdom</a> used to provide a very simple
external check service, but now they have added more complex multistage
checks as well as real user monitoring to the basic ping. We&rsquo;ll choose
the plan with 250 checks, 20 Real User Monitoring sites and 500 SMS
alerts for <em>$107 a month</em>.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-much">How much!</h2>

<p>In total that all comes to <em>$35,080 (Â£20,922)</em> per month, or
<em>$420,960 (Â£251,062)</em> per year.</p>

<p>Now the first reaction of lots of people will be <em>that&rsquo;s a lot of money</em>
and it is. But remember open source isn&rsquo;t free either. We need to pay
for:</p>

<ul>
<li>The servers we run our monitoring software on</li>
<li>The people to operate those servers</li>
<li>The people to install and configure our monitoring software</li>
<li>The office space and other costs of employing people (like management
and hiring)</li>
</ul>

<p>I think people with the ability to build software tend to forget they
are expensive, whether as a contractor or as a full time member of
staff. And people without management experience tend to forget costs
like insurance, rent, management overhead, recruitment, etc.</p>

<p>And probably more important than these for some people we need to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>The time taken to build a good open source monitoring system</li>
</ul>

<p>The time needed to put together a good monitoring stack based on for
instance logstash, kibana, riemann, sensu, graphite and collectd isn&rsquo;t
small. And don&rsquo;t forget the number of other moving parts like redis,
rabbitmq and elasticsearch that need installing configuring and
maintaining. That probably means compromising in the short term or
shipping later. In a small team how core is building your monitoring
stack to what you do as a business?</p>

<h2 id="but-i-can-t-use-saas">But I can&rsquo;t use SaaS</h2>

<p>For some people, using a software as a service product just isn&rsquo;t going
to cut it. Here&rsquo;s a list of reasons I can think of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Regulation constrains where your data can be stored, for instance it&rsquo;s
not allowed out of the country</li>
<li>Sheer size of infrastructure, although you may be able to get a volume
discount it might not be enough</li>
</ul>

<p>I think everything else is a cost/benefit issue or personal preference
(or bias). Happy to add more to that list, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a very
long list.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve purposefully not talked about the quality of the tools here, just
the cost. I&rsquo;ve also not mentioned that it&rsquo;s likely not an all or nothing
decision, lots of people will mix SaaS products and open source tools.</p>

<p>Whether taking a SaaS approach will be quicker, cheaper or better will
depend on your specific business context. But try and make that about
the organisation and not about the technology.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve never used the current crop of SaaS monitoring
tools (and not just the one&rsquo;s mentioned above) then I think you&rsquo;re missing
out. Even if you stick with a mainly open source monitoring stack you
might look at your tools a bit differently after you&rsquo;ve experimented
with some of the commercial competition.</p>

      <span class="post-date">Feb 5, 2014 &middot; 3 minute read
      </span>
      
      

<p>A little while ago I published a <a href="https://github.com/garethr/puppet-module-skeleton">template writing your own puppet modules</a>. It&rsquo;s
very opinionated but comes out of the box with lots of the tools you
eventually find and add to your tool box. I&rsquo;m posting this as it came
up at the recent <a href="http://cfgmgmtcamp.eu">Configuration Management Camp</a>
and after discussing it I realised I hadn&rsquo;t actually wrote anything
about it anywhere.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-you-get">What do you get?</h2>

<ul>
<li>A simple install, config, service class pattern</li>
<li>Unit tests with <a href="https://github.com/rodjek/rspec-puppet">rspec-puppet</a></li>
<li>Rake tasks for <a href="https://github.com/rodjek/puppet-lint">linting</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gds-operations/puppet-syntax">syntax checking</a></li>
<li>Integration tests using <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker">Beaker</a></li>
<li>A Modulefile to provide Forge metadata</li>
<li>Command line tools to upload to the Forge with <a href="https://github.com/maestrodev/puppet-blacksmith">blacksmith</a></li>
<li>A README based on the Puppetlabs documentation standards</li>
<li><a href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis CI</a> configuration based on the official
Puppetlabs support matrix</li>
<li>A Guardfile which can run all the tests when you change manifests</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously you can choose not to use parts of this, or even delete
aspects, but I find that approach much quicker than starting from scratch
or copying files from previous modules and changing names.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-use-it">How can I use it?</h2>

<p>Simple. The following will install the module skeleton to
<code>~/.puppet/var/puppet-module/skeleton</code>. This turns out to be picked up
by the Puppet module tool.</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span>git clone https://github.com/garethr/puppet-module-skeleton 
<span style="color: #003388">cd</span> puppet-module-skeleton
find skeleton -type f | git checkout-index --stdin --force --prefix=<span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;</span><span style="color: #336699">$HOME</span><span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">/.puppet/var/puppet-module/&quot;</span> --
</pre></div>

<p>With that in place you can then just run the following to create a new
module, where puppet-ntp is the name of our new module.</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span>puppet module generate puppet-ntp
</pre></div>

<p>We use <code>puppet module</code> like this rather than just copying the files
because otherwise you would have to rename everything from class names
to test assertions. The skeleton actually contains erb templates in
places, and running <code>puppet module generate</code> results in the module name
being available to those templates.</p>

<h2 id="now-what">Now what?</h2>

<p>Assuming you have run the above commands you should have a folder called
<code>puppet-ntp</code> in your current directory. <code>cd</code> into that and then install
the dependencies:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span>bundle install
</pre></div>

<p><a href="http://bundler.io/">Bundler </a>is a dependency manager for Ruby. If you
don&rsquo;t already have it installed you should be able to do so with the
following:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span>gem install bundler
</pre></div>

<p>Now you have the dependencies why not run the full test suite? This
checks syntax, lints the Puppet code and runs the unit tests.</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span>bundle <span style="color: #003388">exec</span> rake <span style="color: #003388">test</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Unit tests give fast feedback and help make sure the code you write is
going to do what you intend, but they aren&rsquo;t actually applying the
manifests to a real machine. For that you want an integration test.
You&rsquo;ll need <a href="http://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> installed for this next
step. Lets run those as well with:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span>bundle <span style="color: #003388">exec</span> rspec spec/acceptance
</pre></div>

<p>This will take a while, especially the first time. This uses Beaker to
download a virtual machine from Puppetlabs (if you don&rsquo;t already have
it) and then brings up a new machine, applies a simple manifest, runs
the acceptance tests and then destroys the machine.</p>

<p>The <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file has more information for running the test
suite.</p>

<h2 id="what-s-new">What&rsquo;s new?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve recently added a <a href="https://github.com/guard/guard">Guardfile</a> to
help with testing. You can run this with:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span>bundle <span style="color: #003388">exec</span> guard
</pre></div>

<p>Now in a separate tab or pane make a change to any of the manifests. The
tests should run automatically in the tab or pane where guard is
running.</p>

<h2 id="can-you-add-this-new-tool">Can you add this new tool?</h2>

<p>Probably. Although I started the repo a few other people have
contributed code or made improvements already. Just sent a pull request
or open an issue.</p>

<p>One of my favourite topics for a while now has been <em>infrastructure as
code</em>. Part of that involves introducing well understood programming
techniques to infrastructure - from test driven design, to refactoring
and version control. One tool I&rsquo;m fond of (even with it&rsquo;s potential to
be misused) is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage">code coverage</a>. I&rsquo;d been meaning
to go code spelunking to see if this could be done for testing Puppet
modules.</p>

<p>The functionality is now in <a href="https://github.com/rodjek/rspec-puppet#producing-coverage-reports">master for rspec-puppet</a>
and so anyone feeling brave can use it now, or if you must wait for the
2.0.0 release. The actual implementation is inspired by the same functionality in
<a href="https://github.com/sethvargo/chefspec#reporting">ChefSpec</a>
written by <a href="https://sethvargo.com/">Seth Vargo</a>. Lots of the how came
from here, and the usage is very similar.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-it">How to use it?</h2>

<p>First add (or hopefully change) your Gemfile line item for rspec-puppet
to the following:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span>gem <span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;rspec-puppet&quot;</span>, <span style="color: #aa6600; background-color: #fff0f0">:git</span> =&gt; <span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&#39;https://github.com/rodjek/rspec-puppet.git&#39;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Then all you need to do is include the following line anywhere in a
spec.rb file in your spec directory.</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span><span style="color: #336699">at_exit</span> { <span style="color: #336699">RSpec</span>::<span style="color: #336699">Puppet</span>::<span style="color: #336699">Coverage</span><span style="color: #a61717; background-color: #e3d2d2">.</span><span style="color: #336699">report</span>! }
</pre></div>

<h2 id="what-do-i-get">What do I get?</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an <a href="https://github.com/garethr/garethr-nginx">example module</a>,
including a file called
<a href="https://github.com/garethr/garethr-nginx/blob/master/spec/classes/coverage_spec.rb">coverage_spec.rb</a>.
When running the test suite with <code>rake spec</code> you now get coverage
details like so:</p>

<pre><code>Total resources:   24
Touched resources: 8
Resource coverage: 33.33%

Untouched resources:
  Class[Nginx]
  File[preferences.d]

  File[sources.list]
  Exec[Required packages: 'debian-keyring debian-archive-keyring' for nginx]

</code></pre>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the output on <a href="https://travis-ci.org/garethr/garethr-nginx/jobs/17597307#L105">Travis CI</a> as
well for a recent build.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-this-useful">Why is this useful?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already found coverage useful when writing tests for a few of my
puppet modules. The information about the total number of resouces is
interesting (and potentially an indicator of complexity) but the list of
untouched resources is the main useful part. These represent both
information about what your module is doing, and potential things you
might want to test.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m hoping to find some more time to make this even better, providing
more information about untouched resources, adding some configuration
options and hopefully to integrate with the <a href="https://coveralls.io/docs/api">Coveralls API</a>.</p>

      </h1>
      <span class="post-date">Jan 12, 2014 &middot; 4 minute read
      </span>
      
      

<p>As of a few weeks ago <a href="http://kitchen.ci/">Test Kitchen</a> has a <a href="https://github.com/test-kitchen/test-kitchen/blob/master/lib/kitchen/provisioner/shell.rb">shell provisioner</a> as well as the original Chef provisioners. This opens up all sorts of interesting testing potential.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve not already seen Test Kitchen, probably because you&rsquo;re not using Chef, it&rsquo;s a tool for integration testing infrastructure code. Configured by a simple YAML file it will setup a matrix of virtual machines, using Virtualbox, AWS, OpenStack and more, run some setup code (normally applying Chef recipes) and then run a test suite (with support for Bats, ShUnit2, Rspec and Serverspec). It&rsquo;s all very pluggable. With the addition of the shell provisioner it&rsquo;s useful to just about anyone. To try and prove that here&rsquo;s a hello world style example.</p>

<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>

<p>First we need to install Test Kitchen. We&rsquo;ll use vagrant and virtualbox for our example too so we need a few extra dependencies. I&rsquo;m going to assume you have bundler installed, if not you may be able to do so with <code>gem install bundler</code> but as the number of ways of setting a ruby environment up is greater than the number of people on the planet I&rsquo;ll have to defer to instructions elsewhere for getting that far.</p>

<p>First create a file called <code>Gemfile</code> with the following contents:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span>source <span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;https://rubygems.org&quot;</span>

gem <span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;test-kitchen&quot;</span>, <span style="color: #aa6600; background-color: #fff0f0">:git</span> =&gt; <span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;https://github.com/test-kitchen/test-kitchen.git&quot;</span>
gem <span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;kitchen-vagrant&quot;</span>
gem <span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&quot;vagrant-wrapper&quot;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Then run:</p>

<pre><code>bundle install
</code></pre>

<p>This should install the above software. Note that the shell provisioner is not yet in an official release so where installing direct from GitHub for the moment.</p>

<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>

<p>Next we&rsquo;ll tell Test Kitchen what we want to do. As much for demonstration purposes I&rsquo;m going to grab one of the Puppetlabs boxes. This is just plain <a href="http://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> so feel free to substitude the <code>box</code> and <code>box_url</code> for alternatives you already have installed locally. Otherwise the first run will take a little longer as it downloads a large file.</p>

<p>Pull all of the following in a file called `.kitchen.yml&rsquo;.</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span><span style="color: #bb0066; font-weight: bold">---</span>
driver:
  name: vagrant

provisioner:
  name: shell

platforms:
  - name: puppet-precise64
    driver_config:
      box: puppet-precise64
      box_url: http://puppet-vagrant-boxes.puppetlabs.com/ubuntu-server-12042-x64-vbox4210.box

suites:
  - name: default
</pre></div>

<p>The shell provisioner is going to look for a file called <code>bootstrap.sh</code> by default. You can overide this but we&rsquo;ll leave it for the moment. Our bootstrap script is going to do something very simple, install the ntp package. But the important part is it could do anything; run Salt, run Ansible, run Puppet, execute any arbitrary code we choose. In this case our script is completely self contained but if it needed some additional files we could put them in a directory called <code>data</code> and they would be copied to the newly created virtual machine under <code>/tmp/kitchen</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span><span style="color: #888888">#!/bin/bash</span>

apt-get install ntp -y
</pre></div>

<h2 id="tests">Tests</h2>

<p>The last step is to write a test. I&rsquo;m suddently finding lots of excuses to use <a href="http://serverspec.org/">Serverspec</a> so we&rsquo;ll use that, but if you prefer you can use pretty much anything. The following file should be saved as  <code>test/integration/default/serverspec/ntp_spec.rb</code>. Note the <code>default</code> in the path which matches our suite above in the <code>.kitchen.yml</code> file. Test Kitchen allows for multiple suites all with separate tests based on a strong set of file path conventions.</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #ffffff"><pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span><span style="color: #003388">require</span> <span style="color: #dd2200; background-color: #fff0f0">&#39;serverspec&#39;</span>

<span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">end</span>

  it { should be_enabled }
  it { should be_running }
<span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">end</span>
</pre></div>

<h2 id="running-the-tests">Running the tests</h2>

<p>With all of that in place we&rsquo;re ready to run our tests.</p>

<pre><code>bundle exec kitchen test
</code></pre>

<p>This should:</p>

<ul>
<li>download the virtual machine image if you don&rsquo;t already have it locally</li>
<li>create a new virtual machine based on the image</li>
<li>run the bootstrap.sh script</li>
<li>run our serverspec test suite</li>
</ul>

<p>The real power comes from doing this iteratively as you work on code, probably code more complex than a simple one-line bash script. You can also test across multiple virtual machines at a time, for instance different operating systems or different machine roles. The <code>kitchen</code> command line tool provides lots of help too, with the ability to login to machines, verify that specific combinations of platform and suite are working and print lots of diagnotic information to aid development.</p>

<p>Hopefully this will make it into a release soon, and we&rsquo;ll see more involved examples using higher level tools and more documentation. But even now I&rsquo;d be looking at Test Kitchen for any infrastructure testing you might be doing.</p>

      </h1>
      <span class="post-date">Jan 1, 2014 &middot; 2 minute read
      </span>
      
      

<p><a href="http://www.packer.io/">Packer</a> provides a great way of describing the steps for creating a virtual machine image. But it doesn&rsquo;t have a built-in way of verifying those images.</p>

<p><a href="http://serverspec.org/">Serverspec</a> provides a nice framework for writing tests against infrastructure, asserting the operation of services or the installation of packages.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m interested at the moment in building continous delivery pipelines for infrastructure components and have a simple working example of <a href="https://github.com/garethr/packer-serverspec-example">testing Packer with Serverspec</a> on
Github. The example uses the AWS builder and the Puppet provisioner but the approach should work with other combinations.</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t represent a complete infrastructure pipeline, but it does demonstrate an approach to automating one particular component - building base images.</p>

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>

<p>In our example I&rsquo;m using the <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-ntp">Puppetlabs NTP</a> module to install and configure NTP. Once the Puppet provisioner has run, but before we build the AMI (or other virtal machine image) we run a test suite. For our example the tests are pretty simple:</p>

<pre><code>describe package('ntp') do
  it { should be_installed }
end

describe service('ntp') do
  it { should be_enabled   }
  it { should be_running   }
end
</code></pre>

<p>If the tests fail, Packer will stop and the AMI won&rsquo;t be built. The combination of storing the code (Packer template) alongside a test suite (Serverspec) and building a new AMI whenever you change the code, makes this setup perfect for continuous integration.</p>

<h2 id="wercker-builds">Wercker builds</h2>

<p>As an example of a continuous integration setup the repository contains a <a href="https://github.com/garethr/packer-serverspec-example/blob/master/wercker.yml">wercker.yml</a> configuration file for the excellent <a href="http://devcenter.wercker.com/">Wercker</a> service. Wercker makes setting up multi-step built pipelines easy and nicely configurable via a simple text file in your repository.</p>

<p>The Wercker <a href="https://app.wercker.com/#applications/52c450e489daaf145f001ad8">build for this project is public</a>. Currently the build involves downloading Packer, running <code>packer validate</code> to check the template and eventually running <code>packer build</code> to boot an instance and run our serverspec tests.</p>

<p><em>Originally written as part of <a href="http://sysadvent.blogspot.co.uk/2013/12/day-21-making-web-secure-one-unit-test.html">Sysadvent 2013</a>.</em></p>

<p>Writing automated tests for your code is one of those things that,
once you have gotten into it, you never want to see code without tests
ever again. Why write pages and pages of documentation about how
something should work when you can write tests to show exactly how something does work? Looking at the number and quality of testing tools and frameworks (like cucumber,
rspec, <a href="https://github.com/test-kitchen/test-kitchen">Test Kitchen</a>,
<a href="http://serverspec.org/">Server Spec</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker">Beaker</a>,
<a href="http://casperjs.org/">Casper</a> and
<a href="http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/">Jasmine</a> to name a few) that have
popped up in the last year or so I&rsquo;m obviously not the only person who
has a thing for testing utilities.</p>

<p>One of the other things I am interested in is web application
security, so this post is all about using the tools and techniques
from unit testing to avoid common web application security issues. I&rsquo;m
using Ruby in the examples but you could quickly convert these to other languages if you desire.</p>

<h2 id="any-port-in-a-storm">Any port in a storm</h2>

<p>Lets start out with something simple. Accidentally exposing
applications on TCP ports can lead to data loss or introduce a vector
for attack. Maybe your main website is super secure, but you left the
port for your database open to the internet. It&rsquo;s the server configuration equivalent of forgetting to lock the back door.</p>

<p>Nmap is a tool lots of people will be familiar with for spanning for
open ports. As well as a command line interface Nmap also has good
library support in lots of languages so lets try and write a simple
tests suite around it.</p>

<pre><code>require &quot;tempfile&quot;
require &quot;nmap/program&quot;
require &quot;nmap/xml&quot;

describe &quot;the scanme.nmap.org website&quot; do
  file = Tempfile.new(&quot;nmap.xml&quot;)
  before(:all) do
    Nmap::Program.scan do |nmap|
      nmap.xml = file.path
      nmap.targets = &quot;scanme.nmap.org&quot;
    end
  end

  @open_ports = []
  Nmap::XML.new(&quot;scan.xml&quot;) do |xml|
    xml.each_host do |host|
      host.each_port do |port|
        @open_ports &lt;&lt; port.number if port.state == :open
      end
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>With the above code in place we can then write tests like:</p>

<pre><code>it &quot;should have two ports open&quot; do
 @open_ports.should have(2).items
end

it &quot;should have port 80 open&quot; do
 @open_ports.should include(80)
end

it &quot;should have port 22 closed&quot; do
 @open_ports.should_not include(22)
end
</code></pre>

<p>We can run these manually, but also potentially as part of a
continuous integration build or constantly as part of a monitoring
suite.</p>

<h2 id="run-the-guantlt">Run the Guantlt</h2>

<p>We had to do quite a bit of work wrapping Nmap before we could write
the tests above. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if someone had already wrapped
lots of useful security minded tools for us? <a href="http://gauntlt.org/">Gauntlt</a> is pretty much just that, it&rsquo;s a security testing framework based on cucumber which currently supports curl, nmap, sslyze, sqlmap, garmr and a bunch more tools in master. Lets do something more advanced than our port scanning test above by testing a URL for a SQL injection vulnerability.</p>

<pre><code>@slow
Feature: Run sqlmap against a target
  Scenario: Identify SQL injection vulnerabilities
    Given &quot;sqlmap&quot; is installed
    And the following profile:
      | name       | value                                      |
      | target_url | http://localhost/sql-injection?number_id=1 |
    When I launch a &quot;sqlmap&quot; attack with:
      &quot;&quot;&quot;
      python &lt;sqlmap_path&gt; -u &lt;target_url&gt; âdbms sqlite âbatch -v 0 âtables
      &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Then the output should contain:
      &quot;&quot;&quot;
      sqlmap identified the following injection points
      &quot;&quot;&quot;
    And the output should contain:
      &quot;&quot;&quot;
      [2 tables]
      +-----------------+
      | numbers         |
      | sqlite_sequence |
      +-----------------+
      &quot;&quot;&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>The Gauntlt team publish <a href="https://github.com/gauntlt/gauntlt/tree/master/examples">lots of examples</a> like this one alongside the source code, so getting started is easy. Gauntlt is very powerful, but as you&rsquo;ll see from the example above you need to know quite a bit about the underlying tools it is using. In the case above you need to know the various arguments to sqlmap and also how to interpret the output.</p>

<h2 id="enter-prodder">Enter Prodder</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/garethr/prodder">Prodder</a> is a tool I put together
to automate a few specific types of security testing. In many ways
it&rsquo;s very similar to Gauntlt; it uses the cucumber testing framework
and uses some of the same tools (like nmap and sslyze) under the hood.
However rather than a general purpose security framework like Gauntlt,
Prodder is higher level and very opinionated. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>

<pre><code>Feature: SSL
  In order to ensure secure connections
  I want to check the SSL configuration of my servers
  Background:
    Given &quot;sslyze.py&quot; is installed
    Scenario: Check SSLv2 is disabled
      When we test using the &quot;sslv2&quot; protocol
      Then the exit status should be 0
      And the output should contain &quot;SSLv2 disabled&quot;

    Scenario: Check certificate is trusted
      When we check the certificate
      Then the output should contain &quot;Certificate is Trusted&quot;
      And the output should match /OKâââ(Common|Subject
</code></pre>

<p>This is a little higher level than the Gauntlt exampleâââit&rsquo;s not
exposing the workings of sslyze that is doing the actual testing. All
you need is an understanding of SSL certifcates. Even if you&rsquo;re not an
expert on SSL you can accept the aforementioned opinions of Prodder
about what good looks like. Prodder currently contains steps and
exampes for port scanning, SSL certificates and security minded HTTP
headers. If you already have a cucumber based test suite (including
one based on Gauntlt) you can reuse the step definitions in that too.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m hoping to build upon Prodder, adding more types of tests and
getting agreement on the included opinions from the wider systems
administration community. By having a default set of shared assertions
about the expected security of out system we can more easily move onto
new projects, safe in the knowledge that a test will fail if someone
messes up our once secure configuration.</p>

<p>As well as trying out some of the above tools and techniques for
yourself I&rsquo;d recommend encouraging more security conversations in your
development and operations teams. Here&rsquo;s a few  places to start with:</p>
