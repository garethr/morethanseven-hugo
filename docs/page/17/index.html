      <p><a href="http://www.phpied.com/">Stoyan Stefanov</a> just released an excellent little <a href="http://www.phpied.com/content-to-markup-ratio-bookmarklet/">bookmarklet to calculate a content to markup ratio</a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s interesting browsing around a few sites and comparing ratios:</p>

      <p>I gave a short presentation about App Engine last night at the <a href="http://campug.org.uk/">Cambridge Python User Group</a> and as always it&rsquo;s available on <a href="http://slideshare.net">Slideshare</a>.</p>

<p><object style="margin:0px" width="425" height="355">
<param name="movie" value="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=appengine-090304031400-phpapp02&stripped_title=app-engine-for-python-developers" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/><embed src="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=appengine-090304031400-phpapp02&stripped_title=app-engine-for-python-developers" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="355"></embed></object></p>

<p>I find App Engine a great way of just writing (Python) code and putting it online quickly, and the presentation was aimed at being something of a fanboy ode. During questions afterwards we talked about some of the limitations and cases where App Engine isn&rsquo;t as well suited, and at least a few people were heading off planning on having a play.</p>

<p>The event was good fun and I picked up a few Python related tips and tricks from the other presentations and general conversation. Thanks for everyone who organised and attended the event and to <a href="http://www.realvnc.com/">RealVNC</a> for hosting the talks.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;ve finally been getting round to doing a bit of work on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/dmigrations/">dmigrations</a>, the Python based database migration tool we developed at <a href="http://thisisglobal.com">work</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>dmigrations offers a simple but flexible way of managing changes to the database in your Django projects. It is a replacement for Django&rsquo;s built in syncdb command.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I still have some work to do to merge in a number of modifications we&rsquo;ve been running internally for a while but I&rsquo;ve triaged the issues list that had been left alone for too long and merged in a fantastic collection of patches from a few people including Alexander Robbins and <a href="http://chris-lamb.co.uk/">Chris Lamb</a>. Thanks hugely to everyone for these.</p>

<p>Everything is available in <a href="http://code.google.com/p/dmigrations/source/browse/#svn/trunk">trunk in SVN</a> at the moment ahead of me cleaning a few thinks up and updating the download version. I&rsquo;ve added a setup.py file as well ahead of hopefully adding it to the <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi">Python Package Index</a>.</p>

<p>I obviously wasn&rsquo;t the only one who had decided to do some work on the project in the last couple of days. <a href="http://www.djangosnippets.org/users/msaelices/">msaelices</a> has just submitted <a href="http://code.google.com/p/dmigrations/issues/detail?id=21">a patch</a> which adds a <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> backend. I don&rsquo;t tend to use PostgreSQL personally so if anyone does want to have a look at running dmigrations with the patch I&rsquo;d love to hear about it.</p>

      </h1>
      <span class="post-date">Feb 28, 2009 &middot; 2 minute read
      </span>
      
      <p>I&rsquo;ve been busy building and playing with various HTTP clients recently, mainly due to more playing with RESTful web services. I took a couple of hours out to build something to make my life easier - namely a very simple <a href="http://github.com/garethr/django-http-debug/tree/master">logging HTTP server in Django</a>.</p>

<p>All the application does is accepts HTTP requests and log the results to a file. I&rsquo;ve been using it to make sure the requests I&rsquo;m sending from elsewhere are correct, before pointing the client at a web service that actually does something useful. It supports POST, GET, PUT, DELETE, etc. So far so simple.</p>

<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cgwLEgVJbWFnZRjSDww" alt="screenshot showing us tailing the logs"/></p>

<p>I ended up using Django mainly because I did most of the work on the train, and I know my way around it pretty well by now. I did originally thing it might have been better to use something simpler but I did end up learning a few new tricks that I&rsquo;ll use for future projects.</p>

<ul>
<li>In theory <a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/1807">Django doesn&rsquo;t need a database</a>. While this is true for the most part, the in-built test runner does require a database. One thing I&rsquo;ve talked about before is the usefulness of creating your own custom test runner. If anyone else runs into this specific problem have a look at the <a href="http://github.com/garethr/django-http-debug/blob/0ef82784abfc70cc63444e39f61807675acd5c29/http_debug/lib/nodatabase.py">nodatabase.py</a> file.</li>
<li>The logging is handled via Python&rsquo;s inbuilt logging module. It has some nifty features (like log rotation, maximum file sizes and different logging levels) but is a little fiddly to get working correctly. Tales abound of log messages appearing multiple times, or permission errors causing problems. At least for this project I think I have everything working. I&rsquo;ll try using this <a href="http://github.com/garethr/django-http-debug/blob/0ef82784abfc70cc63444e39f61807675acd5c29/http_debug/lib/log.py">module</a> on a couple of other projects and maybe spin it off into a small reusable app.</li>
</ul>

<p>For something that took only a few hours to write it was both good fun and a useful learning tool. And Django proved itself more useful that I though for smaller services like this.</p>

      <p>I always enjoy reading things by <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com">Paul Graham</a>, even if I&rsquo;d like to be able to disagree with his conclusions on occasion. It&rsquo;s not just that I love <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hackpaint.html">Hackers and Painters</a>, but also he often says things like the following that make me smile:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>hackers are much more constrained by gentlemen&rsquo;s agreements than regulations. If they shake your hand on a promise, they&rsquo;ll keep it. But show them a lock and their first thought is how to pick it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His latest short essay concerns <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/maybe.html">startup hubs</a> again, something that I&rsquo;m actually pretty interested in, end up talking to <a href="http://imranali.name/">people</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/herbkim">about</a>, but hardly ever writing anything on. Mike over at Techcrunch Uk elicited some good comments last year with a <a href="http://uk.techcrunch.com/2008/07/29/starting-the-campaign-for-the-techhub/">post on the subject</a>. As usual Graham focuses on the US, but what about translating his idea of buying a Startup Hub and applying it to the UK? He sets several criteria for success:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do you have good weather?</li>
<li>Do people live downtown, or have they abandoned the center for the suburbs?</li>
<li>Would the city be described as &ldquo;hip&rdquo; and &ldquo;tolerant,&rdquo; or as reflecting &ldquo;traditional values?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Are there good universities nearby? Are there walkable neighborhoods?</li>
<li>Would nerds feel at home?</li>
</ul>

<p>Lets assume for the moment that the idea would work. Take £15-20million and invest in 30 or so well chosen startups on the condition they move into town. The question is then: <strong>where in the UK would this be most likely to work? And are their any UK specific criteria that would increase the success rate?</strong></p>

<p>Some people might be thinking &ldquo;but no UK city is going to invest £20million in a scheme to encourage startups&rdquo;. Leeds is <a href="http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/business-news/Universities-bid-to-help-.4979184.jp">doing just that</a>. Or rather Yorkshire Forward are putting up £35million along with Leeds University putting up £31milion. What are they doing with all that money? They are going to build a big building with it - which is exactly what Graham says won&rsquo;t work.</p>

      <p>I quite like <a href="http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/">Epydoc</a> for generating Python API documentation, even if the interface looks a little dated and could do with a lick of paint.</p>

<p>For most project I use an Ant build script to generate documentation when needed. You could wrap the basic commands in a make file or a bash script if you prefer that sort of thing though. The only trick is to make sure you have everything you need on your Python Path. In Django projects, or App Engine projects, you&rsquo;ll probably find the default runner script plays with the path somewhat. The following example adds the current directory to the path along with an ext directory where I stash external modules, which should see it run cleanly without any import errors.</p>

<p>pre. <project name="secretproject" default="create-api">
<property name="name" value="secretproject"/>
<property name="parent" value="/www/projects"/>
<property name="api" value="/www/project/secretproject/api"/>
<target name="create-api" description="Generate API documentation with epydoc">
<exec executable="/bin/sh">
<env key="PYTHONPATH" value="${parent}:${parent}/${name}/ext:$PYTHONPATH"/>
<env key="DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE" value="${name}.settings"/>
<arg line="-c 'epydoc --html -o ${api} --name ${name} --graph all ${name}'"/>
</exec>
</target>
</project></p>

        <a href="/2009/02/21/example-using-xmpp-app-engine-imified/">Example of using XMPP on App Engine (via IMified)</a>
      </h1>
      <span class="post-date">Feb 21, 2009 &middot; 3 minute read
      </span>
      
      <p>As I <a href="http://morethanseven.net/2009/02/07/xmpp-and-offline-processing-coming-google-app-engi/">mentioned before</a>, App Engine is getting an XMPP API at some point soon. But if you just can&rsquo;t wait to start adding IM interfaces to your applications then you <em>can</em> do it now, by using a nifty third party in <a href="http://imified.com/">IMified</a>.</p>

<p>IMified provide an incredibly simple HTTP API for interacting with your own IM bot. If we want to be buzz word compliant we might even call it a <a href="http://webhooks.pbwiki.com">webhook</a>. It&rsquo;s also currently a free service while they work through the beta. The <a href="http://new.imified.com/developers/api">documentation</a> is short and to the point but only contains examples in PHP. It supports multiple step <em>conversations</em> as well as authentication.</p>

<p>So, armed with a little time on the train over the last few days I got to work knocking together a quick demo application as a proof of concept. You can find the site on <a href="http://imified-demo.appspot.com/">imified-demo.appspot.com</a> and if you want to chat with the bot you can add <em>appengineimified@bot.im</em> to your contacts. The bot uses the Jabber protocol so is available over Jabber or GTalk. IMified make it easy to use MSN or Yahoo IM accounts as well, which is something the App Engine API might very well not do I would imagine.</p>

<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cgwLEgVJbWFnZRjRDww" alt="Screengrab of the IMified App Engine site"/></p>

<p>As always you can find the code on <a href="http://github.com/garethr/appengine-imified/tree/master">GitHub</a>. Most of the code is actually just the site itself or settings to make local development easier. The following is a slightly edited version of the live code (logging and caching removed to make it easier to follow). All we need to do is accept a HTTP Post request with a list of arguments and return a plain text response. All being well the response is sent as a IM message to the sender.</p>

<p>pre. class IMified(webapp.RequestHandler):
&ldquo;This is the endpoint for the message from IMified&rdquo;
def post(self):
&ldquo;We recieve post data from IMified&rdquo;
userkey = self.request.get(&lsquo;userkey&rsquo;)
network = self.request.get(&lsquo;network&rsquo;)
msg = self.request.get(&lsquo;msg&rsquo;)
step = self.request.get(&lsquo;step&rsquo;)
try:
# we try and create the message
message = Message(
userkey = userkey,
network = network,
msg = msg,
step = int(step)
)
message.put()
# the response is send as an IM message to the sender
self.response.out.write(&lsquo;Message saved&rsquo;)
except:
self.response.out.write(&lsquo;An error ocured, message not saved&rsquo;)</p>

<p>IMified can obviously be used outside App Engine as well, and in fact it&rsquo;s not just about working around limitations in existing systems. Running the long running processes required for bots, and potentially even running your own XMPP server, is fiddly at times and requires at least some setup, monitoring and configuration to get working. Not having that as a barrier for entry for simple experiments or applications is a good thing.</p>

<p><a href="http://aralbalkan.com/">Aral</a> spoke at the last <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-london">DJUGL</a> about App Engine and mentioned a wide range of third party services that you can use to get around current limitations. IMified definitely fits into this group of support services very nicely indeed. I&rsquo;d love to see them do really well as it really makes it much easier to get started with XMPP applications, even if what you can do is limited to a few simple APIs. I&rsquo;d love to hear about other services that people are using in this way to build these distributed applications.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;m working on a small project involving using RESTful APIs and wanted a simple HTTP client, something that sat a little higher in the stack than <a href="http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/">httplib2</a> or similar. I turned initially to the <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/models/test_client/">Django Test Client</a> which now <a href="http://code.google.com/p/python-rest-client/">supports all the required methods</a> but it turned out that I&rsquo;d have to unpick it from django a little.</p>

<p>With a little bit of looking around I found the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/python-rest-client/">python-rest-client</a> which certainly sounded like it would do what I wanted. It lets you make HTTP requests in as straight forward a manner as possible and fitted the bill perfectly.</p>

<p>pre. from restful_lib import Connection
conn = Connection(&ldquo;<a href="http://morethanseven.net&quot;">http://morethanseven.net&quot;</a>)
response = conn.request_get(&ldquo;/&rdquo;)</p>

<p>It supports authentication, nice helper methods and gives you the response in a nice format.</p>

<p>pre. conn = Connection(&ldquo;<a href="http://example.org&quot;">http://example.org&quot;</a>, username=&ldquo;XXX&rdquo;, password=&ldquo;XXX&rdquo;)
conn.request_delete(&lsquo;/items/11232344&rsquo;)</p>

<p>As an added benefit it also comes with a Google App Engine compatible version.</p>

      <p>The previous <a href="http://morethanseven.net/2009/02/11/django-settings-tip-setting-relative-paths/">Django settings tip</a> seemed to go down well so I thought I&rsquo;d jot down a few more over the next few weeks. Most of these have come out of working with a decent sized Django team at <a href="http://thisisglobal.com">Global</a> so I can&rsquo;t take credit for anything but writing them down for the most part. For this example I think <a href="http://alixandalex.com/obfuscated-signatures/">Alex Knowles</a> did the original version.</p>

<p>I was talking with out friendly <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~rclamp/">sys</a> <a href="http://www.unixdaemon.net/">admins</a> on Friday about a new application and whether they were happy with some application specific logging (using the Python logging module) I&rsquo;d build in. Nothing fancy, just application logging to a rotated log file for system events. Their answer was yes, as long as they could control where the log files ended up and the maximum file size, ideally without having to play around in the code or to redeploy the application if they wanted to move the files elsewhere.</p>

<p>These things were already specified in the settings file rather than hardcode into the application but that only gets us half way. The standard Linux way of setting this sort of thing is with a configuration file stored in the /etc directory. So we ended up with the following snippet of code in our settings.py file.</p>

<p>pre. # we&rsquo;re going to allow overriding of settings via a yml file.</p>

<ol>
<li>This makes live nicer for anyone managing the box</li>
<li>and means settings can be overloaded without redeploying the site
SETTINGS_OVERIDE = &ldquo;/etc/application_name.yml&rdquo;
try:
file = open(SETTINGS_OVERIDE)
for key, value in yaml.load(file).items():
globals()[key]=value
except:
# we don&rsquo;t always have the file around or need the setting
# defined so best to be quite if things go wrong
pass</li>
</ol>

<p>Then in the yaml file you can simply clobber any of the settings using a simple name value pair approach.</p>

<p>pre. LOG_FILE: &ldquo;/var/log/application_name.log&rdquo;</p>

<p>It lets us keep production paths that might change out of the developers code, at the same time as giving the sys admins a familiar way of managing the production environment.</p>

<p>It does have one downside, if you&rsquo;re not aware of it&rsquo;s presence then it can make debugging settings related issues a pain. With that in mind you could wrap it so as to only work this way when DEBUG is False, or take the approach here which is to leave extensive comments.</p>
