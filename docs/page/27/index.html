      <p><em>Long time no post. Lots of excuses, time away (including a holiday) and work catching up with me. Hopefully expect a few quick fire posts to catch up and then back to normal.</em></p>

<p>I was in London a couple of weeks back, mainly to help out at <a href="http://futureofwebapps.com">FOWA</a> (which can get it&rsquo;s own post) but also to generally catch up with lots of people about interesting stuff. After using my Monopoly knowledge of London to find the apple store (something some <a href="http://www.thecssdiv.co.uk/">Londers</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/rossbruniges/statuses/307080542">took issue with</a>) I heard about an event round the corner thanks to the magic of the internets (in this case <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://upcoming.org">Upcoming</a> and <a href="http://www.builtbydave.co.uk/">Dave Stone</a>).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mashupevent.com/event/mashup-demo">Mashup Demo</a> was billed as &ldquo;a simple and effective way for startups, growing businesses, enterprises and corporates to present themselves to an audience of professionals who would include:- investors, media journalists and bloggers, potential partners and industry influencers&rdquo;. When first chatting with one of the exhibiting companies they looked me up and down and said &ldquo;so, are you a blogger?&rdquo;. Apparently I didn&rsquo;t look much like a VC. Who knew?</p>

<p>Fifteen lightning presentations made up the bulk of the event, with me taking notes using my handy N800 (another blog post probably), and then followed a good amount of time to wander about and chat with everyone, probably about 100 people all in all. The companies presenting represented lots of the <em>hot topics</em> at the moment shall we say. Anyone not mentioning mobile, or social networking (or both!) had come to the wrong party.</p>

<p>Local Search had a strong showing from <a href="http://welovelocal.com">welovelocal.com</a>, <a href="http://www.rummble.com">Rumble</a>, and <a href="http://www.tipped.co.uk">tipped.co.uk</a>. The thorny problem of local was one of the really interesting discussion topics at the <a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/labs/">BBC innovation labs</a> earlier in the year and it&rsquo;s good to see interesting ideas of how to solve it. Although personally I don&rsquo;t need <em>another</em> social network and also want to be able to define what I mean by local (not just be given a location, or have it based on a pool of friends, or whatever the latest looking glass is).</p>

<p>Identity was suprisingly popular with both <a href="http://www.bondaii.com">Bondai</a> and <a href="http://www.meecard.com/">meecards</a> talking up their applications. Obviously with all the cool kids playing with <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenId</a> and the alpha geeks tinkering with <a href="http://oauth.net/">OAuth</a> identity is technologically interesting, but both these companies have spotted commercial opportunities as well. Be interesting to see how this all plays out. I&rsquo;ve rambled on before about what I called Banks for Data (as apposed to money, which is just data anyhow when you think about it) but not really considered early movers and entrepreneurs in this sector.</p>

<p>A couple of interesting takes on agregators dropped in as well.
<a href="http://fav.or.it/">fav.or.it</a> was pitched as trying to popularise feeds for everyone else, but looked to me to actually be more of a useful tool for the information hungry crowd. It&rsquo;s innovative features (inline commenting looked nice) would likely not be that interesting to people with only a few feeds and a few minutes but for people with hundreds of feeds look interesting. <a href="http://www.magpie.net/brandwatch.html">Brandwatch</a> was similar to an idea a friend and me kicked around a while back, but never put together. Simply put it finds stories relating to your brand (company, product, whatever) and ascertains the importance and whether it&rsquo;s positive or negative. You can then track all that over time with useful graphs and charts and the like. At the moment they are indexing about 500,000 sites and it still uses some manual filtering I think. Even so I know of clients past who would definately find the service offered interesting.</p>

<p>A few others caught my eye; an ad network for bloggers based on their blog rolls called <a href="http://www.rollsense.com/">rollSense</a>, a service simliar to <a href="htp://slideshare.com">slideshare</a> but for business documents called <a href="&quot;http://www.edocr.com/">Edocr</a> and <a href="http://testcard.tv">testcard.tv</a>. Testcard.tv does some really pretty impressive agregation, stitching and searching of online video. Sort of a glimpse of the future, but probably not as pretty. Optimising that for the Wii or PS3 (or keyboard/remote control) would be awesome.</p>

<p>After chatting with a few of the companies, and other people in the crowd, I popped for sushi with the aforementioned Dave for discussions of the freelance life I&rsquo;ve got myself in to. The event was pretty darn interesting. That the companies presenting were, for the majority, proper startups was interesting. And the fact the whole event was geared around product centric companies and the surrounding eco-system interested me. I get to similar business events up and around newcastle, but these tend to be more service company orientated it seems. All in all Mashup Demo kicked my stay down in London off nicely.</p>

        <a href="/2007/09/16/getting-going-with-symfony/">Getting going with Symfony</a>
      </h1>
      <span class="post-date">Sep 16, 2007 &middot; 4 minute read
      </span>
      
      <p>I&rsquo;ve tinkered with a rather large number of these web application frameworks, in Ruby, Python, PHP and C#, at some point over the last few years. But I&rsquo;ve never really settled on any of them - mainly because my day job didn&rsquo;t need me to and also because I like playing with new toys. I even tinkered with <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/webphp/">my own homage</a> to <a href="http://webpy.org/">Web.py</a> in PHP which a few people have picked and are <a href="http://code.google.com/p/wephp/">running with</a>.</p>

<p>Right now though I&rsquo;ve been doing some work with a <a href="http://rbd.shiftnetwork.co.uk/">few</a> <a href="http://www.bofh.org.uk/">people</a> on a Rails project. Their are some seriously nice things in Rails that I don&rsquo;t see elsewhere; really good testing support baked in for one, and some serious deplyments for another.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.symfony-project.com/">Symfony</a> is another PHP framework but one that only supports PHP5 (a good thing in my book). It&rsquo;s basically a slick integration of lots of existing mature PHP tools plus some good old MVC and tried and trusted Software Patterns. I also discovered from a few YAHOO&rsquo;s that they have started using it on some levels within YAHOO.</p>

<p>My interest piqued I found a couple of <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/fullo/federico-feroldi-php-in-yahoo/">related</a> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/dustin.whittle/symfony-yui-professional-web-20">presentations</a> on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">Slideshare</a> (my new favourite web app), and the site has a <a href="http://www.symfony-project.com/book/1_0">high quality online documentation</a> which can also be <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Definitive-Guide-Symfony-Experts-Source/dp/1590597869">purchased in dead tree format</a>.</p>

<p>Having a play around with Symfony it took me a little while to get everything up and running, but I&rsquo;d kept some handy notes for later. Hopefully they might be useful to someone other than me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve dropped in a few variables denoted by braces where relevant. The paths are from my MAMP and PEAR based environment and I&rsquo;m using a MySQL database, though you could just as easily use Sqlite.</p>

<p>First we set up a virtual host in Apache. You have to do this manually at the moment. I already have a script for setting up virtual hosts under apache on OS X which I might extend to do this for me if I end up using Symfony alot.</p>

<p><code></p>

<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost 127.0.0.1&gt;
  ServerName 
  DocumentRoot &quot;/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/{project}/web&quot;
  DirectoryIndex index.php
  Alias /sf /Applications/MAMP/bin/php5/lib/php/data/symfony/web/sf
  &lt;Directory &quot;/Applications/MAMP/bin/php5/lib/php/data/symfony/web/sf&quot;&gt;
    AllowOverride All 
    Allow from All
  &lt;/Directory&gt;
  &lt;Directory &quot;/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/{project}/web&quot;&gt;
    AllowOverride All
    Allow from All
  &lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></code></p>

<p><code></p>

<pre><code>cd /www
mkdir {project}
cd {project}
</code></pre>

<p></code></p>

<p>Now we dive into the actual symfony commands. We&rsquo;ll just setting up both a frontend and a backend for this app which I think is likely to be pretty typical. I quite like the idea of seperate entities for these.</p>

<p><code></p>

<pre><code>symfony init-project {project_name}
symfony init-app frontend
symfony init-module frontend {module_name}
</code></pre>

<p></code></p>

<p>Next we have to configure our database connection by editing /config/databases.yml</p>

<p><code></p>

<pre><code>all:
    propel:
      class: sfPropelDatabase
      param:
        dsn: mysql://{username}:{password}@localhost:3306/{database_name}
</code></pre>

<p></code></p>

<p>That done we can set up our data definitions in <em>/config/schema.yml</em>. Read the documention for all the details but you can probably get the general idea.</p>

<p><code></p>

<pre><code>propel:
 item:
   id:
   title: varchar(200)
   description: longvarchar
   created_at:
</code></pre>

<p></code></p>

<p>And yet another quick change in <em>/config/propel.ini</em></p>

<p><code></p>

<pre><code>propel.database.createUrl = mysql://{username}:{password}@localhost:3306
propel.database.url = mysql://{username}:{password}@localhost:3306/{database_name}
</code></pre>

<p></code></p>

<p>The next set of commands build our model files, create SQL for out chosen database and then create the tables in the database.</p>

<p><code></p>

<pre><code>symfony propel-build-model
symfony propel-build-sql
symfony propel-insert-sql
</code></pre>

<p></code></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll quickly create a backend using the scaffolding. Note that <em>item</em> here is the model name which is taken from the <em>schema.yml</em> config file above.</p>

<p><code></p>

<pre><code>symfony init-app backend
symfony propel-generate-crud backend items Item
</code></pre>

<p></code></p>

<p>All in all not bad going. And that&rsquo;s basically the same for most of the apps you&rsquo;re likely to develop. It could probably be a little easier in the database and apache config areas in fairness. Rails&rsquo; use of an inbuild webserver really helps here. But the use of YAML to define the model is, in my mind, more straightforward that using Ruby in Rails migrations. I&rsquo;ve an app in the works at the moment and I&rsquo;m looking at using Symfony. If that pans out I&rsquo;ll blog more about the bits I&rsquo;m interested in - the inbuilt unit testing framework high on my list.</p>

      <p>Back from a madcap weekend in Brighton for the <a href="http://2007.dconstruct.org/">dconstruct</a> BarCamp Brighton double header. If I was to write down everything I can remember we&rsquo;d be here for a week. If I was to write down simply everything then we&rsquo;d be here longer still. Information packed just doesn&rsquo;t cover it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll likely sort some more detailed posts on some particular topics that piquet my interest in the coming weeks or months, for instance user centred design vs agile methodologies (thanks to <a href="http://www.disambiguity.com/">Leisa Reichelt</a>), some more rambling posts on web application frameworks, microformats for write APIs, OAuth and countless other things I&rsquo;ve no doubt forgotten.</p>

<p>One thing you can get now is my BarCamp presention which I&rsquo;ve uploaded to <a href="http://slideshare.net">SlideShare</a>. I&rsquo;ve not used this much previously but I&rsquo;m smitten and will be uploading a few other past presentions in the next few weeks as soon as I can find them. If you&rsquo;re interested in RESTful architectures or Rabbits then this might float your boat:</p>

<p><object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="http://s3.amazonaws.com/slideshare/ssplayer.swf?id=106632&doc=restful-rabbits310" width="425" height="348">
<param name="movie" value="http://s3.amazonaws.com/slideshare/ssplayer.swf?id=106632&doc=restful-rabbits310" /></object></p>

<p>I also took lots of photos (some with <a href="http://cackhanded.net">Norm&rsquo;s</a> very nice 1.4f 50mm lens, thanks Norm) whick I&rsquo;ll get on <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> when I get a moment. Expect lots of portraits of people (maybe including you?) for once instead of odd abstract architecture and textures.</p>

<p>Final thing I&rsquo;ll say for now is a big thankyou to anyone or everyone who sorted all this out. The 600-700 geeks descending on brighton all got fed, watered/beered and educated without anything appearing to go wrong (except when the hotel bar ran out of beer - I blame <a href="http://nascentguruism.com/">Steve Marshall</a>). I&rsquo;m looking at you <a href="http://clearleft.com">clearlefties</a> and <a href="http://www.glennjones.net/Home/">Glenn</a> and everyone from Madgex. Good job everyone involved.</p>

      <p>More interesting Newcastle centric news, although this time partly releveant to everyone else - well, as long as you live in Oxford, Brighton, Leeds or Manchester that this.</p>

<p><a href="http://notes.natbat.net/">Natalie Downe</a> has spent some of her copious spare time (having left the agency way of life and gone all <a href="http://notes.natbat.net/2007/08/19/freelance/">freelance</a> too) cooking up <a href="http://geekvenues.com/">Geekvenues</a>. It&rsquo;s an attempt to map (using Google Maps) any and all geek related venues around the UK. Local meetup places perhaps, regular venues, or just geek friendly pubs with wifi.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been adding some venues for Newcastle and they can be found over at <a href="http://newcastle.geekvenues.com/">newcastle.geekvenues.com/</a>. If anyone knows of any other ones let me know. And if anyone is thinking &ldquo;I want it to cover my neck of the woods&rdquo; then get in touch with Nat, ideally with a link to a KML file of locations. I&rsquo;m looking at <a href="http://www.azcazandco.com">Alan</a> and <a href="http://sneeu.com/blog/">John</a> from Edinburgh in particular here.</p>

      <p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgOpenCoffee.png" alt="Open Coffee" title="Open Coffee" /></p>

<p>OpenCoffee Newcastle is a new, open, informal and regular meetup for technology entrepreneurs, designers, bloggers, developers, geeks, investors and anyone else whoâ€™s interested.</p>

<p>We are going to meet every Thursday morning, between 10am and 12pm, at <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the+side+cafe+newcastle">The Side</a> just off Newcaste Quayside.</p>

<p>The first event will be held on September 13th. So come and share ideas, demo, get to know each other or just have a coffee.</p>

<p>OpenCoffee Newcastle is part of the global community effort over at <a href="http://www.opencoffeeclub.org">opencoffeeclub.org</a>. Here&rsquo;s <a href="http://localglobe.blogspot.com/2007/02/opencoffee-club.html">the blog post that started it all</a></p>

<p>With all that out of the way a little bit of background and some geekier links. I&rsquo;d been meaning to get an OpenCoffee event up and running for a while and after a couple of chats in nice pubs with <a href="http://sam.aaron.name/">Sam</a> and a trip to The Side we had a date and a vague plan. Worst case is it&rsquo;s me and Sam just meeting up but hopefully a few more people will make it along. We should have wireless as well for any demos.</p>

<p>Note I&rsquo;ll likely be somewhat wired. I might be up in edinburgh the night before for <a href="http://www.futureofwebapps.com/roadtrip/">FOWA roadtrip</a> and in any case I&rsquo;ll have been up all night at <a href="http://www.barcampbrighton.org/">barcampbrighton</a>.</p>

<p>You can register for the <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/254890/">event on upcoming</a> or even register for <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/group/3537/">the group</a>. Or you could just turn up. See you there! Any questions post a comment (either here on on upcoming) or drop me an email.</p>

      </h1>
      <span class="post-date">Aug 19, 2007 &middot; 3 minute read
      </span>
      
      <p>When I&rsquo;m writing code, be it CSS, Javascript, Ruby, whatever, I don&rsquo;t like big bulky IDE&rsquo;s. Give me <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> or Vim any day. Going all freelance I now have the occasional need to produce nice documents and being in charge means I get to decide what I use to produce them. I never really liked working in Microsoft Word so decided against it. But rather than sensibly going for an obviously alternative I decided to just use HTML, or rather more specifically, <a href="http://textism.com/tools/textile/">Textile</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgOnlineDocs.png" alt="An example of a current document" title="An example of a current document" /></p>

<p>As an old time <a href="http://textpattern.com">textpattern</a> I learned to love the simple text transformation language and it&rsquo;s inclusion in the <a href="http://37signals.com">37signals</a> apps made me smile and more likely to use them. Why use it over HTML you may ask? For me I think about HTML like a browser, as a tree of nodes. I end up spending quite a bit of time writing content then going backwards and wrapping what I just wrote in markup. This is fine for your typical site, but for writing documents it&rsquo;s hard to get into a flow. With textile I can flow in one direction.</p>

<p>So far I&rsquo;m liking it alot. I can seperate content from presentation (Word styles are a myth), easily repurpose my content (text, html, pdf) and write documents in anything I like, including Word if I chose to.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a pretty good excuse to play with various bits of CSS3, including multi-columns, advanced layout, generated content and the various print offerings. Given I can control the rendering engine then produce a PDF to distribute I can use anything that the latest browser builds can deal with.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve not got all the workflow steps automated yet, I&rsquo;m using Firefox to print documents to PDF (via Preview) at the moment which works fine but is still a manual process I can get rid of using something like <a href="http://www.re.be/css2xslfo/">css2xslfo</a> and <a href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/">fop</a>. I&rsquo;m also pretty sure the PDFs won&rsquo;t be accessible, although the original markup certainly should be.</p>

<p>As I produce more complex documents I&rsquo;ll likely miss things like automated table of contents generation, footnotes and page numbering but, then again, I can write that in Javascript (or on the server) if I so choose. I was impressed listening to HÃ¥kon Wium Lie at <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2007/">@media</a> about the process they used to format his last book using CSS and <a href="http://www.princexml.com/">PrinceXML</a>. I&rsquo;m half tempted to spend time rolling all this together into a web app. It would be pretty good fun really; APIs, XSLT, CSS, PDF, some nice UI problems, etc. Only problem I see would be entering a market contested by Microsoft, Google, Sun and er, lots of others.</p>

      </h1>
      <span class="post-date">Jul 31, 2007 &middot; 3 minute read
      </span>
      
      <p><a href="http://benmetcalfe.com/blog/index.php/2007/07/31/some-thoughts-on-good-conferences-to-attend/">Ben Metcalfe</a> just posted a run down of some thoughts on conferences to attend. With all my travels this year I thought I&rsquo;d join in.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spend quite a bit of time this year travelling the UK for various get togethers, conferences, meetups and the like and had great fun doing so. I go mainly because nowhere else do I find quite such a critical mass of smart interesting people to have a pint with and discuss the intricacies of the web. For 2007, in roughly chronological order: <a href="http://www.webdd.org.uk/">WebDD</a>, <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampLondon2">Barcamp London</a>, <a href="http://www.futureofwebapps.com/">Future of Web Apps</a>, <a href="http://thehighlandfling.com">Highland Fling</a>, Refresh Edinburgh, <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2007/">@media</a>, <a href="http://www.hackday.org/">Hackday</a>. I&rsquo;ll be at <a href="http://2007.dconstruct.org/">dConstruct</a>, Future of Web Apps (again) and possibly <a href="http://www.future-of-mobile.com">Future of Mobile</a> and a Rails meetup in London as well to finish off the year.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t go on about how cool <a href="http://barcamp.org/">Barcamp</a> was. I actually think the whole unconference thing sits alongside the more formal conference scene quite nicely rather than acting as a direct challenge. Safe to say if you have yet to make a Barcamp then be on the lookout (although if you could not pick brighton please. I really want to go and it&rsquo;s going to be hard enough to get tickets anyway!)</p>

<p>Highland Fling was excellent. Alan did a bang up job of picking a pretty focused topic and getting a gang of safe hands in to do the talking. Everything seemed to follow on from the previous talk, or catch a thread only touched on earlier in the day. This turned out to be down to the specific topic rather than some pre-conference collusion which I thing bodes well for other such topic centric mini-conferences. It was all rounded off (as all conferences must be) with a rousing talk from <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/">Andy Clarke</a> and a panel chaired by <a href="http://adactio.com/">Jeremy <del>Paxman</del> <em>Keith</em></a>.</p>

<p><code>media is still the daddy of the UK web standards scene. Personally I want more advanced materials and I'd love to see more audience interaction, but the scale of it makes that a little difficult I acknowledge. I'll keep going as long as I learn something new and come away feeling a little bit inspired. I'll be going next year. Maybe it's not going to hit the heights of the very first</code>media a couple of years back but that was my first trip out into the world. Oh, and <a href="http://www.htmldog.com/">patrick</a> throws good parties in pubs with beer.</p>

<p>I think dConstruct is basically a grown up Highland Fling. It was great fun last year so here&rsquo;s hoping it&rsquo;s as much fun this year. Again, the idea of a particular topic is in place. I&rsquo;m still thinking about <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmediaAjax/">@media Ajax</a> if I can get enough work together to pay for it (note to people trying to keep up - I now <a href="http://garethrushgrove.com">work for myself as a freelancer</a>) and I have a sneaking suspicion I&rsquo;ll want to get along to <a href="http://www.future-of-mobile.com/">Future of Mobile</a> in a couple of months too.</p>

<p>My plan for next year is to try and get out of the country and hopefully to some of the events in the US and Europe that offer something different. <a href="sxsw.com/">SXSW</a> is an obvious choice, but I&rsquo;d be interested in any other ideas on top of Ben&rsquo;s list. I&rsquo;d also like to think in a year of so I might even end up talking at some nice event or other - but I need to pick a topic and stick to it I reckon instead of flitting between whatever I feel like that afternoon. Oh and probably practice.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;m having quite a bit of fun with my rabbit, <em>cambridge</em>, at the moment. Their were a number of projects at <a href="http://hackday.org">Hackday</a> involving the ever so cute <a href="http://nabaztag.com">Nabaztag</a> and I had a feeling I&rsquo;d probably go home and adopt one. The idea of a rabbit with APIs was simple too much fun.</p>

<p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgNabaztag.jpg" alt="Nabaztag" title="Nabaztag" /></p>

<p>The Nabaztag API docs can be found in two places (the rest of the site unfortunately has a number of issues when it comes to finding information easily); in the <a href="http://help.nabaztag.com/fiche.php?langue=3&amp;fiche=29#none">help section</a> and on the <a href="http://api.nabaztag.com/docs/home.html">API site</a>. The latter are much better than the former by the way.</p>

<p>Lots of people have already been hacking on the wireless rabbit. Their are some good tools over on the <a href="http://nabaztools.sourceforge.net/">Nabaztag Sourceforge project</a>, a handy <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/nabaztag/">Ruby module</a> and a <a href="http://pear.php.net/pepr/pepr-proposal-show.php?id=463">prospective</a> <a href="http://tmp.lfms.nl/nabaztag/">PEAR module</a> for PHP.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been getting more and more into the ideas behind <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">REST</a> recently and one thing that disappointed me a litte was the HTTP RPC style Nabaztag API (note to anyone thinking REST simply means using a GET request rather than something like SOAP or XML-RPC, it doesn&rsquo;t). I couldn&rsquo;t help seeing PUTs to ears and POSTs to the mouth.</p>

<p>Inspired a little by <a href="http://www.aralbalkan.com/">Arals</a> <a href="http://aralbalkan.com/994">Bunny Talk</a> I&rsquo;ve started implementing parts of the API in a RESTful manner, and used my API abstraction layer to build a similar application.</p>

<p>Head over to <a href="http://morethanseven.net/presents/nabaztag/">morethanseven.net/presents/nabaztag/</a> and send me a message (via my rabbit obviously) or, er, play with <em>cambridges</em> ears (he likes that). At the moment the API is configured only for my rabbit, although you can download the source code and run it yourself if you like. It requires PHP5 at the moment as one of the required modules is PHP5 only. But you are using <a href="http://gophp5.org/">PHP5 now</a> aren&rsquo;t you?</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to use the form you can access the API directly. Here are a couple of examples using curl:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;curl http://morethanseven.net/presents/nabaztag/ears/left&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;curl -X 'PUT' http://morethanseven.net/presents/nabaztag/ears/left/13&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;curl -X 'POST' -d &quot;message&quot; http://morethanseven.net/presents/nabaztag/mouth&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Their&rsquo;s a litte documentation in the source. I&rsquo;ll add more methods, more documentation and maybe make an API anyone with a Nabaztag can use by authenticating either as I need it or if people actually want it. Let me know what you think (via the rabbit obviously!)</p>

      </h1>
      <span class="post-date">Jul 15, 2007 &middot; 3 minute read

      <p>My latest job has allowed me to get back into playing with <a href="http://rubyonrails.com">Rails</a>, something I&rsquo;ve been meaning to do for a year or so. Having got everything up to date and installed on my virtual server and on my laptop I couldn&rsquo;t resist seeing if I could get it going on my <a href="http://www.nseries.com/products/n800">N800</a>.</p>

<p>The reasons for this are mainly that the idea of a wireless web server in my pocket is pretty intriguing. Think about it. If you&rsquo;re at an event with Wi-Fi you can just point people to an IP address and hey presto they have access to your details, or a set of photos, or whatever you want to show them. I&rsquo;ve also got nginx installed, but I&rsquo;m not as yet that up on running python or PHP behind it on the N800. So, no need to carry around the laptop. OK, maybe it&rsquo;s just me and all this going to web conferences? We&rsquo;ll have to see if I actually knock up anything useful for the next conference and see. Saving that I&rsquo;ve been travelling quite a bit recently and it&rsquo;s handy when reading a Rails book to be able to try out the examples.</p>

<p>Anyway, it turns out that you can indeed <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/kwe/484269853/">install Ruby and Rails on the N800</a>, although their isn&rsquo;t much information around and non of it worked exactly as stated for me - hence this post.</p>

<p>I followed along with a <a href="http://www.digitalknk.com/2007/05/27/howto-ruby-on-rails-on-your-nokia-n800/">pretty good tutorial</a>, although I already had Red Pill Mode, XTerm and SSH installed. Ruby is also now available in the <a href="https://garage.maemo.org/projects/ruby185/">Garage</a>.</p>

<p>The crux of the post is that you can find the required packages, in particular for Gem, <a href="http://pierre.droids-corp.org/maemo/">here</a>. But unfortunately that is were the problems start. I ran into exactly the same problem as described in the comments in the above post, on <a href="http://railsgrunt.com/2007/5/14/installing-ruby-on-rails-on-the-n800">this blog post</a> and on this <a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/">Internet Tablet Talk</a> <a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/forums/showthread.php?t=5442&amp;page=2">forum thread</a>. Specifically, Gem hanging, crashing or returning a segmentation fault in the yaml.rb file on line 133.</p>

<p>The problem appears to be (this is me guessing here) with gem and the N800 being able download all the info for Gem to update it&rsquo;s package list. The solution, or rather a suitable workaround, is to download the individual gems yourself to the local file system or a memory card and then install them from there. You can get all the Rails gems <a href="http://pierre.droids-corp.org/maemo/gems/">here</a>. A quick script/server later and I had the familiar Rails welcome screen on port 3000. This should in theory work for oher gems as well. You can either download them directly or use Gem on a local machine and them move the files across via bluetooth or USB.</p>

      <p>Being busy is to be expected with this new start-up malarkey but whoa. The problem is I have even more ideas for real posts or articles (the type you research, play around with, then write properly) and, for the next few weeks, not the time to do them justice. I&rsquo;ll be back with gusto when I find the time. In the interim here are a few things from the last month or so I consider <em>cool</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li>I has <a href="http://www.nabaztag.com/en/index.html">Nabaztag</a>! Sorry, but I couldn&rsquo;t resist after <a href="http://hackday.org">Hackday</a>. Expect API hacking and silly photos on flickr aplenty.</li>
<li>Oh, <a href="http://hackday.org">Hackday</a> was an absolute blast. Thanks to Matt, Ian, Tom and the cast of hundreds.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m working on a cool Ruby on Rails app in the real world, up here in Newcastle no less.</li>
<li>&ldquo;<code>media&quot;:http://vivabit.com/atmedia2007 was, yet again, fab. A (very) late shout to Patrick and the umper lumpers. Can I make it to</code>media Ajax?</li>
<li><a href="http://refreshnewcastle.org/">Refresh Newcastle</a> got a minor update with more flickr and upcoming goodness. Tag things <em>refreshnewcastle</em> for some lovin.</li>
<li><a href="http://hedgehoglab.com">hedgehoglab.com</a> has a few more pages, a <a href="http://hedgehoglab.com/training/survey">survey on web training needs</a> and more microformats than you can shake a stick at.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll be at <a href="http://dconstruct.org">dconstruct</a> (just). Another jigsaw piece of my increasingly bloody minded attempt to get to as many UK web get-togethers as possible.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll be along to <a href="http://rubyandrails.org/usergroups/newcastle/">ncl.rb</a> tomorrow night (thursday) and in the pub afterwards if anyone is around. Their have been a few good events in Newcastle recently, only some of which I&rsquo;ve managed to get along to. I&rsquo;m considering getting an <a href="http://www.opencoffeeclub.org/">Open Coffee</a> do up and running in Newcastle as well. If anyone is interested let me know.</li>
</ul>

<p>More (interesting) work beckons&hellip;</p>
