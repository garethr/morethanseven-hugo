      </h1>
      <span class="post-date">Feb 1, 2009 &middot; 3 minute read
      </span>
      
      <p>I&rsquo;ve been playing around with the <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinarta</a> Ruby web development framework recently and building a <a href="http://github.com/garethr/sinatra-hello-world">larger than usual Hello World Example</a>. It&rsquo;s describes itself as <em>a DSL for quickly creating web-applications in Ruby with minimal effort</em> (what is it about Ruby people and their obsession with calling everything a DSL?). In reality it&rsquo;s a great little web framework. It deals with a minimal set of the things you really need to do as part of any application - URL handling and routing, HTTP request and response handling, etc. It reminds me of <a href="http://webpy.org/">web.py</a> in it&rsquo;s minimalist approach which is definitely a good thing.</p>

<p>The following example is the hello world given on the site</p>

<p>pre. require &lsquo;rubygems&rsquo;
require &lsquo;sinatra&rsquo;
get &lsquo;/&rsquo; do
&lsquo;Hello world!&rsquo;
end</p>

<p>Which isn&rsquo;t a million miles away from a web.py example:</p>

<p>pre. import web
urls = (
&lsquo;/&rsquo;, &lsquo;hello&rsquo;
)
app = web.application(urls, globals())
class hello:
def GET (self, name):
return &lsquo;Hello World&rsquo;
if <em>name</em> == &ldquo;<em>main</em>&ldquo;:
app.run()</p>

<p>The only real difference is the separate mapping of URLs to views in web.py, which is closer to how Rails or Django do things.</p>

<p>Their is quite a bit of <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/documentation.html">documentation</a> already for Sinatra, including the start of a <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/book.html">book</a>. The code (as with all good code these days) is on <a href="http://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/tree/master">github</a> for your forking pleasure.</p>

<p>As for what I&rsquo;ve been up to I have a more advanced <a href="http://github.com/garethr/sinatra-hello-world">Hello World</a> example up on GitHub. I&rsquo;m wanting to get a running application that demonstrates all the basic features (except <a href="http://morethanseven.net/2008/04/11/dsls-for-html-and-css-the-future-or-just-plain-wro/">HAML and SASS</a> support). So far I&rsquo;ve got a simple bit of Rack middleware, several views demonstrating different url handling techniques, basic erb templates, before methods, configuration settings, error handling, decent unit test coverage, a rake file with a tasks for documentation, code coverage, etc. I&rsquo;ve also got configuration files for running the application with <a href="http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/">Thin</a> and using <a href="http://god.rubyforge.org/">God</a>. I&rsquo;m going to add some simple database connectivity in at some point (either <a href="http://datamapper.org">DataMapper</a> or <a href="http://sequel.rubyforge.org/">Sequel</a>, I haven&rsquo;t decided yet) and play around with writing spec tests and a capistrano recipe file. All in it&rsquo;s a nice way of learning something new at the same time as producing something that might be useful. Once I have the rest of the bits and pieces I might even right a full tutorial.</p>

<p>I think the sweet spot for these sorts of mini frameworks are small services or little applications that just sit their are run. Both <a href="http://integrityapp.com/">Integrity</a> and <a href="http://irclogger.com">IRCLogger</a> both use Sinatra for instance and I think it&rsquo;s used for the <a href="http://github.com/guides/post-receive-hooks">GitHub WebHooks</a> as well. It&rsquo;s exactly the sort of thing Google AppEngine is useful for in fact and Sinatra would likely be a closer fit that Rails if Google ever feel like adding Ruby support. Although it does depress me a little that the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/list">top four items in the public issue tracker</a> are <em>I want my own language</em>.</p>

      <p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/jsonpickle">Jsonpickle</a> is a Python library for serializing any arbitrary object graph into JSON. The advantage over something like simplejson is the <em>arbitrary</em> part, simplejson throws errors when you try and serialize some types of objects. I also prefer the jsonpickle API (encode, decode) over simplejson (dump, dumps, load, loads).</p>

        <a href="/2009/01/24/defence-apache-ant/">In Defence of Apache Ant</a>
      </h1>
      <span class="post-date">Jan 24, 2009 &middot; 3 minute read
      </span>
      
      <p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of the <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> build tool. Their I said it. Nearly everyone else I end up talking to about build scripts (more people that you&rsquo;d think, but OK, it&rsquo;s hardly the most exciting topic of conversation) either hates it or treats it with disdain.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using it for a few years on and off, in several jobs and for personal projects as well. I&rsquo;ve used it while writing Python, .NET and PHP. It might be somewhat unfashionable (it&rsquo;s written in Java and you write your commands in XML) but, for me at least, it&rsquo;s incredibly handy to have around.</p>

<p>Ant is a build tool. It lets you define tasks in a config file (called build.xml) and then execute them via running the <em>ant</em> command line application. It supports dependencies between tasks as well as defining properties that can be used by multiple tasks. It supports a lot of Java specific stuff as well but also has the ability to simply execute commands on the host OS.</p>

<p>As a really simple example of a few tasks I use on more than one project involve simple backups and deployment.</p>

<p>First I set up a few properties including details of where my site files live and the SSH access details for the remote site.</p>

<p>pre. <property name="username" value=""/>
<property name="host" value=""/>
<property name="dir" value=""/></p>

<p>The first example task simply runs a backup of everything in the target directory using scp.</p>

<p>pre. <target name="backup" description="backup site" >
<exec executable="scp" dir="." failonerror="true">
<arg value="-r"/>
<arg value="${username}@${host}:${dir}"/>
<arg value="backups/${TODAY_UK}"/>
</exec>
</target></p>

<p>If I make local changes and want to push them to the live site I have another simple task which shells out to rsync.</p>

<p>pre. <target name="deploy" description="deploy usng rsync" >
<exec executable="rsync" dir="." failonerror="true">
<arg value="-r"/>
<arg value="."/>
<arg value="${username}@${host}:${dir}"/>
<arg value="--exclude-from=rsync.excludes"/>
<arg value="-v"/>
</exec>
</target></p>

<p>I know <a href="http://simonwillison.net">some people</a> hate this separate arguments as individual elements. Yes it&rsquo;s excessively XML but it makes everything incredibly clear to anyone who might sneak a look. And build scripts change little compared to project code so the verbosity never bothers me overly. If you really want you can put everything on one line, but I find that harder to follow and maintain.</p>

<p>pre. <target name="deploy" description="deploy usng rsync" >
<exec executable="rsync" dir="." failonerror="true">
<arg line="-r . "${username}@${host}:${dir} --exclude-from=rsync.excludes -v"/>
</exec>
</target></p>

<p>For bigger projects I tend to create more complex backup and deployment tasks, or more often than not add in various dependencies. But you hopefully get the idea. Even for simple commands like this that would be a single line bash script I tend to use ant. I find by putting things together into a build script I&rsquo;m more likely to add useful functionality to it later, and to remember and therefore run the commands more often.</p>

<p>A good reference for finding out more than is in the <a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/index.html">manual</a> is the <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/ant/FrontPage">Apache Ant Wiki</a>. More than anything it features real examples that you can learn from which with Ant is definitely the best way to discover new tricks.</p>

<p>I know their are a number of other tools in languages I like more. On occasion I use <a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org/">Rake</a>, <a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/fab">Fabric</a> and <a href="http://www.capify.org/">Capistrano</a>. I&rsquo;ve looked at <a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/projects/vellum/">Vellum</a> and good old make. I know others who swear by just writing simple bash scripts or using straight Ruby, PHP or Python (or not writing build scripts at all and doing everything by hand. But I like having my build scripts separate and simple. It might not be pretty or fashionable, but Ant does almost perfectly what I want it to do.</p>

      <p>The second <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/1463406">Django User Group (DJUGL)</a> meeting was last night and was a great success as far as I could tell. Our boardroom at work was chock full of budding Django developers and interested parties - 70 people or so in all. Good work by Rob to get everything back on track at the start of the year and the next event is already planned for the back end of February so I hear. More news soon on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-london">mailing list</a> hopefully.</p>

<p>Rather unfortunately <a href="http://simonwillison.net">Simon</a> had to pull out at the last minute and I stepped in to do a quick 20 minutes or so talk on writing tests for your Django applications.</p>

<p><div style="width:425px;text-align:left" id="__ss_933741">
<object style="margin:0px" width="425" height="355">
<param name="movie" value="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=testingdjangoapps-1232444197115958-3&rel=0&stripped_title=testing-django-applications-presentation" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/><embed src="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=testingdjangoapps-1232444197115958-3&rel=0&stripped_title=testing-django-applications-presentation" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="355"></embed></object></p>

<p></div>
I was rather surprised that only about a third of the people coming along were using Django in some work related capacity, and when I asked who was writing tests for their code a few more hands went down. Very few of the people <em>not</em> using Django at work are writing tests which is unfortunate (and contrasts rather interestingly with my experiences of the Ruby community).</p>

<p>For a presentation done in less than a day while at work I felt it went OK. testing is a hard sell at the best of times and trying to talk to both those without experience of writing tests and at the same time trying to get in a few of the more interesting things we&rsquo;ve done at work was maybe a bit of an ask.</p>

<p>It not being a blog post round here these days unless I include a link to GitHub I did mention a small project last night in the talk - <a href="http://github.com/garethr/django-test-extensions/">Django Test Extensions</a>. It&rsquo;s more just a collection of useful common testing code: additional assertions, custom test runners, etc. Thanks to <a href="http://agileweb.org/">Ross</a> for the last minute patch with a couple of bug fixes as well.</p>

<p>The other two presentations went great. Andrew talking about the South migrations system and Aral talking about real world Google App Engine were both up my street of things I&rsquo;m interested in. We have video of all the talks as well so hopefully that will make it out into the wild at some point once it&rsquo;s been edited.</p>

      </h1>
      <span class="post-date">Jan 18, 2009 &middot; 3 minute read
      </span>
      
      <p>I&rsquo;ve been knocking together various little instant messaging bots recently, partly as a way to play around with XMPP. As well as using the low level <a href="http://xmpppy.sourceforge.net/">xmppy</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/xmpp4r-simple/">XMPP4R-Simple</a> libraries I&rsquo;ve been having lots of fun with the <a href="http://thpinfo.com/2007/python-jabberbot/">JabberBot</a> framework.</p>

<p>Jabberbot lets you write simple bots incredibly quickly, using simple conventions to determine what commands the bot exposes. It&rsquo;s easier to explain with a simple example. The following bot lets you send the command <em>time</em> to it and returns the current time on the server on which the bot is running. The magic is in the name of the method <em>bot_time</em>. Any methods that start bot_ are automatically exposed as commands for the bot to accept.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll need an xmpp server for the bot to connect to but you could always just register an additional google account and use it over gtalk if you wanted to. Personally I&rsquo;m running <a href="http://www.ejabberd.im">ejabberd</a> on a local Ubuntu VM as well for testing.</p>

<p>pre. from jabberbot import JabberBot
import datetime
class SystemInfoJabberBot(JabberBot):
def bot_time( self, mess, args):
&ldquo;&rdquo;&ldquo;Displays current server time&rdquo;&ldquo;&rdquo;
return str(datetime.datetime.now())
username = &lsquo;my-jabberid@jabberserver.example.org&rsquo;
password = &lsquo;my-password&rsquo;
bot = SystemInfoJabberBot(username,password)
bot.serve_forever()</p>

<p>The JabberBot site has a few more examples as well with fancier features. At the recent Last.fm hackday I spent a bit of time knocking together a bot which talks to the Last.fm API (using the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pylast/">PyLast</a> library for the API backwards and forwards.) I did this mainly as a demonstration of how simple it can be to create a useful command line interface to your API using an instant messaging client.</p>

<p>The code for <a href="http://github.com/garethr/lastbot/tree/master">LastBot</a> is on GitHub. It has a few limitations and doesn&rsquo;t intent to cover anywhere near all the API. When up and running you should be able to talk to it with your IM client. Simply send the user specified in the settings file a message like so:</p>

<p>pre. search {query}</p>

<p>So if you wanted to search for “astley” you would type:</p>

<p>pre. search astley</p>

<p>Which would probably give you:</p>

<p>pre. you probably mean Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley
<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Rick_Astley/_/Never_Gonna_Give_You_Up">http://www.last.fm/music/Rick_Astley/_/Never_Gonna_Give_You_Up</a>
Richard Paul Astley (born February 6, 1966) is an English dance-pop singer,
songwriter and musician. He was born in Newton-le-Willows, St Helens,
Lancashire, England. Astley currently resides in Richmond, Surrey with his
Danish girlfriend, Lene Bausager, and their daughter, Emilie. In 1985, Astley
was playing the club circuit as a singer with a soul band named FBI, when he
was seen by the record producer Pete Waterman and persuaded to come to London
to work at the PWL recording studio.</p>

<p>If the first result that comes back isn’t the one you wanted you can ask for the next result by simply sending next in another message. You can use prev as well to come back through the set.</p>

<p>pre. next</p>

<p>You can always send it a call for help at any time which should return the instructions to you via an IM message.</p>

<p>pre. help</p>

<p>Which should return something like:</p>

<p>pre. Personal LastFM search bot. Useful for looking for tracks you can&rsquo;t
remember the full name of. Or for findind out who sung a track.
search: do a search for tracks
prev: get details about the previous track in the list
next: get details about the next track in the list</p>

<p>More instructions, and the code behind the bot, can be found in the <a href="http://github.com/garethr/lastbot/tree/master">README</a>.</p>

<p>As developers we spend a lot of time using command line interfaces - mainly for speed and because you can cram a lot of functionality into a small amount of screen real estate. We&rsquo;re increasingly spending time debugging API calls as well and exposing your API calls for use by instant messaging clients has the potential to make development easier. Think of the Python interactive shell or of IRB, but for APIs.</p>

      <p>Google <a href="http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2009/01/changes-for-jaiku-and-farewell-to.html">just announced</a> that, once the port of <a href="http://www.jaiku.com">Jaiku</a> to App Engine is complete they will be Open Sourcing the code and stopping official development. I only used Jaiku sporadically in the heady days when everyone had to sign up for a new web 2.0 service every week or be mocked by their colleagues. What really interests me about this move though is what it means for App Engine.</p>

<p>If memory serves <a href="http://www.jaiku.com/blog/2007/08/30/jaiku-from-your-instant-messenger/">Jaiku had an instant message interface</a>. Does that mean App Engine is going to get an XMPP interface?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also presuming the original Jaiku application had at least some features powered by offline processing or used a message based architecture behind the scenes? Or used scheduled batch jobs for reporting or data mungling?</p>

<p>All of these issues are high up on the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/list">App Engine issues list</a> and solutions to these two outstanding problems would move App Engine, in my opinion, to being very cool to being very useful. I&rsquo;ve been impressed with the simple, well designed and well documented current set of APIs and I&rsquo;d love to see a few more added for XMPP and offline processing. If the Jaiku code is open source but relies on Google only APIs it would seem a little odd.</p>

<p>So does anyone have any more information on this? Any passing Googlers who can get us an answer?</p>

      <p>One of several little projects I have up and running on <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> at present is <a href="http://github.com/garethr/localbuilder/tree/master">LocalBuilder</a>. It&rsquo;s a pretty simple little script which watches for changes in a given directory and when they occur runs a given command. I knocked it together to use to trigger the running of a test suite each time I save files in a project. It&rsquo;s written in Python but you could use it to run commands in any language you like.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all pretty simple Python really and is hopefully reasonably commented and tested so if you&rsquo;re interested you can follow along with <a href="http://github.com/garethr/localbuilder/tree/master">the code</a>. If you just want to use the damn thing then:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;./localbuilder --path /path/to/watch --command /command/to/execute&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It turns out Ruby has a much nicer tool to do this and more in autotest, part of the <a href="http://www.zenspider.com/ZSS/Products/ZenTest/">ZenTest</a> suite of testing tools. I&rsquo;m finding more and more very nice bits of code written in Ruby of late, but that&rsquo;s probably a whole different blog post.</p>

      <p>It&rsquo;s the start of another year so that means it&rsquo;s time to start thinking about conferences.</p>

<p>I just found out at the end of last week (<a href="http://twitter.com/binarytales/status/1106721057">via Twitter no less</a>) that I&rsquo;ve been confirmed as one of the speakers for <a href="http://bamboojuice.co.uk">Bamboo Juice</a>. Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/binarytales">Jon</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/richquick">Rich</a> for having me. I&rsquo;m really looking forward to that as it&rsquo;s a new event outside London (at the rather fabulous looking Eden project in Cornwall), which should hopefully mean a chance for a new set of people to go along to what looks like a decent event. I&rsquo;ll have more information about what I&rsquo;m going to be talking about some time between then and now I would imagine, but the emphasis is on practical learnings for working developers and designers.</p>

<p>Apart from that the only other conference I&rsquo;ve confirmed I&rsquo;l be attending so far is <a href="http://www.thinkingdigital.co.uk/">Thinking Digital</a> in May. It was great last year even if I spent the majority of the time running round organising barcamp, moving house or leaving Newcastle. This time I&rsquo;m not involved in any organising (<a href="http://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1095746624">sorry Andy</a>) so I plan on making the most of the talks and general experience. Rumour has it that their will be another barcamp as well so I&rsquo;ll look forward to that too. It will be good to get back up to Newcastle and see people again.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also looking forward to <a href="http://twitter.com/ptg/status/1096802734">what Patrick is up to for @media</a>. It was the conference that started this whole thing rolling in the UK back in the day and now it appears it might be set for a change.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Time to finalise the line-up and web site for a very different (and lower price!) @media &lsquo;09</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As well as these three I&rsquo;ll be keeping my eye out for any news about Xtech, The Highland Fling and any other new upcoming conferences. If you know of anything else leave a comment. I didn&rsquo;t find out about <a href="http://www.thinkvisibility.com/">Think Visibility</a> until it had sold out but I like the idea of smaller, specialised events.</p>

<p>Overall it already looks like being a good year for conference goers in the UK. I&rsquo;ll be on the lookout for barcamp style events as well but I do like a good formal conference as well. Hopefully see a few people at some of these events?</p>

        <a href="/2009/01/02/apis-2009-xmpp-and-webhooks/">APIs in 2009 - XMPP and WebHooks</a>
      </h1>

<p>Everyone has to have a post with a year in the title at the start of the year so I thought I better write something. Rather than one of those personal retrospective emails I thought I&rsquo;d go for something different - a look at what I&rsquo;d like to see in APIs in the coming year.</p>

<h2 id="webhooks">Webhooks</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty interested in the idea of applications exposing <a href="http://webhooks.pbwiki.com/">Webhooks</a> at the moment. It&rsquo;s a pretty simple idea. As a user of a service you can register your own HTTP end points to receive information whenever events occur in the service. Both <a href="http://wiki.shopify.com/WebHook">Shopify</a> and <a href="http://github.com/guides/post-receive-hooks">GiHub</a> have pretty nifty hooks for extending their capabilities for instance. When someone pushes code to a git repository you could send a ping to trigger a process to update the documentation for example.</p>

<p>With the rise of hosted application development environments like <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">AppEngine</a> writing small, nearly throwaway, apps to subscribe to these hooks could become incredibly powerful. It&rsquo;s a lot like how unix programmers think, by piping lots of small applications together to get to the expected end result. It&rsquo;s not a replacement for the more standard read/write API, but it&rsquo;s a potential solution to the need to constantly poll that API for some types of applications.</p>

<p>The idea of public webhooks would be hugely powerful, but would also likely be a scalability nightmare. Imagine if Flickr exposed a hook that you could subscribe to whenever anyone added a public photo. Or Twitter added a hook for when anyone tweeted. These sorts of hooks would quickly be swamped with subscribers. The number of HTTP requests being sent by a service like Flickr under these circumstances would be <em>rather large</em> to say the least. Which is where another technology that&rsquo;s designed for this sort of problem becomes useful.</p>

<h2 id="xmpp-interfaces">XMPP Interfaces</h2>

<p><a href="http://xmpp.org/">XMPP</a> or the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol has been around for a while, although originally under the name Jabber. It&rsquo;s predominantly being used at the moment as a instant messaging protocol, but in reality it&rsquo;s far more general purpose than that. Or rather, IM is generally considered to be between two or more people. But their is no reason that either or all the participants in an XMPP session can&rsquo;t be programs.</p>

<p>On my local machine I&rsquo;m a big fan of the command line for all sorts of simple, and sometimes complex, tasks. If applications expose their APIs via an XMPP bot then you basically have a ready made command line interface to online services via your IM client of choice. Combined with a solution to the public webhook problem mentioned above and you can hopefully see why I find XMPP pretty interesting.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been playing with writing XMPP bots recently, both at our internal hackday and at the recent <a href="http://github.com/garethr/lastbot/tree/master">Last.fm event</a>. Their are various libraries and code examples lying around the internet that make getting started easy enough. With services like <a href="http://imified.com/">Imified</a> getting setup last year I&rsquo;d imagine it will get easier still this year.</p>

<p>As for what I&rsquo;m going to be up to along these lines, we&rsquo;ll have to wait and see. I have a few pet projects that I&rsquo;d like to get off the ground which might be good test beds for this sort of thing. Apart from that I&rsquo;d like to write some <em>getting started</em> style tutorials on some of the technologies involved or maybe a full blown article on the theory if I can find somewhere to publish it. A barcamp presentation or two might also fall off the back if I do get the time to play around a little more. But that&rsquo;s just me. If you&rsquo;re building, or planning on developing, an API for a product at the moment I&rsquo;d suggest having a look at these two areas. They might turn out to just be potential extensions to what you had planned. Or they might turn out to be just the right approach to the problems you&rsquo;ll face getting people to use your API.</p>
