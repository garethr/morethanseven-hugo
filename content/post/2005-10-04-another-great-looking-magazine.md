After <a href="http://andybudd.com">complains</a> of the lack of a decent magazine, and after the passing and resurection of Design in Flight another one raised it’s head. Yeh. Have a look at <a href="http://particletree.com/treehouse/">treehouse</a>.

Another great, low cost ($15), well designed publication that you can print out and read in the moments away from the computer.

OK, so I haven’t read that much yet but what I have was both interesting, informative and hey, pretty well edited.

Thumbs up to any and all involved.
