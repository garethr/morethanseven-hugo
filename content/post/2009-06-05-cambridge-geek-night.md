It's the first [Cambridge Geek Night](http://cambridgegeeknights.net/) next week, on Wednesday the 10th to be precise. You can find more information on [Upcoming](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/2735951/) or on the [Cambridge Geek Night blog](http://cambridgegeeknights.wordpress.com/). The event also has a [twitter feed](http://twitter.com/camgeeknights) to keep up with goings on. If you're in Cambridge you don't want to miss the perfect combination of geeks and beer.
