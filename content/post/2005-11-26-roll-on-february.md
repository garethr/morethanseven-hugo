Well – It looks like february has made a quick move to try and secure the prestigious <em>month of the year</em> award.

</p>
<p>
With two events happening in London, namely <a href="http://clearleft.com">Clearleft’s</a> <a href="http://www.clearleft.com/training/ajax.php">Ajax Training Workshop</a> on the 10th and <a href="http://www.carsonworkshops.com/">Carson Workshops</a> <a href="http://www.carsonworkshops.com/summit/">Future of Web Apps</a> summit on the 8th it’s <em>all go</em> in the rapidly expanding world of web geek meetups.

</p>
<p>
After missing <a href="http://dconstruct.org">d.Construct</a> I dont feel two bad about the outlay for going to both of these, especially with the assistance of my lovely employers. So I need to work out the details; travel, accomodation, what to do on the thursday, etc. but that should hopefully not be too painful. Any suggestions welcome – especially if anyone else is going along to one or both – be good to be in the same hotel as other attendess – I met <a href="http://theintranetblog.blogspot.com/">Nic</a> at <a href="http://atmedia2005.co.uk">@Media</a> last year as she was in the same hotel.

</p>

So, anyone else going along? Want to meet up? Ideas for accomodation or things to do on the Thursday? See you in February!
