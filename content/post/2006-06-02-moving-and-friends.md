I’m afraid you’ll have to bare with me at the moment. I’m busy, moving house, have no internet outside work (except open wi-fi points) and oh, did I mention I’m busy?

</p>
<p>
I have the usual raft of ideas, inability to really finish things unless I try and a dangerous penchant for playing with ever more scripting languages (<a href="http://media.wu-wien.ac.at/">XOTcl</a> anyone?).

Oh, the friends bit? Inspired by <a href="http://molly.com">Molly</a> and her incredible ability to be open about her life, I thought I’d say a huge <strong>Thank you</strong> to everyone who helped me move house this week. Much appreciated. It could have gone oh so wrong, but everyone chipping in meant everything worked out just fine.
