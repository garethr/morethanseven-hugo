After the numerous games of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(game) ">Werewolf</a> at [Barcamp London](http://barcamp.org/BarCampLondon2) recently a few of us [got chatting](http://kid666.com/blog/2007/02/19/werewolf-cards/) about the idea of custom Werewolf cards using [Flickr](http://flickr.com). Well I've just finished a very simple example of this and thought I'd post it up.

Head over to [morethanseven.net/presents/werewolf](http://morethanseven.net/presents/werewolf) for a set of printable cards based on Flickr Machine Tags.

In the future I may enhance this with a nifty interface which lets visitors select the number of each card they want - and I spoke briefly with [Stefan](http://www.whitelabel.org/) from [Moo](http://www.moo.com/) about if it's possible to link into printing them on those lovely Moo cards.

If you want anyone to appear just add the relevant werewolf machine tag!
