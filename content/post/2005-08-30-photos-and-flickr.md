I’ve been a (distant) admirer of <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a> since I had a brief play a while back. Nice interface, good idea and all that. Well I finally got round to setting up a proper account.

I’d recently got myself a reasonable digital camera. Nothing expensive or fancy – in the past whenever I’ve thought about taking photo’s I’ve always got bored and given up. This time is going to be different. Hopefully.

I’ve only really got round to one proper shoot and in non ideal conditions (well, in terms of photography – basically in a room under a pub) but I’m pretty happy with a couple of the photo’s. But maybe that’s because I like somewhat abstract orange/red shots?

Anyway, hopefully I’ll get round to taking and uploading some more shots. And maybe using some of them on this site.
