Well, yesterday was the long awaited <a href="http://carsonworkshops.com/summit">Carson Summit</a> which seemed to go pretty well all in all. Lots of <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/1087/">reviews</a> and <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2006/02/08/summit">notes</a> around at the moment but I’ll just throw a couple of my personal observations into the mix.

</p>
<p>
The presentation where all good, but nothing mindblowing. Most had something going for them; whether <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/">enthusiasm</a>, <a href="http://carsonworkshops.com">numbers</a> or a <a href="http://feedburner.com">special announcement</a>

</p>
<p>
I liked <a href="http://plasticbag.org">Tom Coates</a> diatribe about clean URLs, it something I’m fairly keen on too, I’m uming and arring over whether I too am a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/redux/97126279/">URL Fetishist</a>

</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://google.com">Google</a> vs <a href="http://yahoo.com">Yahoo</a> show was entertaining and interesting. Reading that Google tend to be more academic with Yahoo being a little bit more unhinged/entreprenurial is one thing – going to a conference where the guy from Google came across as something of a mad german professor with something of an <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=javascript">axe</a> to grind, compared to the Yahoo mob who ranged from a <a href="http://plasticbag.org">self confessed hippy</a> to <a href="http://www.iamcal.com/">Cal</a> and his three quarter length trousers. It’s appears all the rumours are true.

</p>
<p>
I did a couple of stints of SubEthaEdit collaborative note taking with <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2006/02/08/summit">Simon</a> which was fun and interesting at the same time. The <em>who’s going to write the next part</em> bit was quite amusing – at times writing the same things down, then everyone deleting them, then a pause.

</p>
<p>
The after show was, as always, good fun and fairly drunken. The pub was nice, but whomever suggested it on the wiki was playing a cruel joke. A conference with 800 geeks and a pub about 3 people wide at it’s widest point is not sensible. Neither was <a href="http://splintered.co.uk">Patrick’s</a> suggestion about not eating, but it all worked out in the end.

</p>
<p>
Was good to meet up with lots of people, both those <a href="http://htmldog.com">I</a> <a href="http://splintered.co.uk">had</a> <a href="http://www.thewatchmakerproject.com/">met</a> <a href="http://pixelicious.co.uk/">before</a> and those that <a href="http://cackhanded.net/">I hadn’t</a>. Hope to see everyone again soon, if not it will have to be <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2006">@media</a>.
