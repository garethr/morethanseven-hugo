It’s rebooting time people. First up a shameless plug for <a href="http://webdesignbookshelf.com">my entry</a> this time around. In the spirit of <a href="http://screenspire.com">screenspire</a> here’s a full length picture for those that cant be bothered to visit the site proper.

Only a couple of reviews up at the moment but we will be adding them as fast as out busy fingers can write them. Big thanks to <a href="http://mtpatto.com">Mathew Patterson</a> and <a href="http://theintranetblog.blogspot.com/">Nicola Dobiecka</a> for their assists here. Otherwise you would just be listening to my blatherings (a little like here then?)

Anyway, let me know what you think. As with all such endeavours more features (and probably fixes) will see the light of day over the next few weeks and months. Once everyone else is up I’ll post my personal faves, along with everyone one else ever.
