<p>
Just a few things coming up in the next month that I’m attending that I thought warranted a post.

WebDD

</td>

3rd February

</td>
<td>
Heading down to Microsoft in Reading for <a href="http://webdd.org.uk">Web Developer Day</a> for a weekend of web design and development discussions and listening to <a href="http://brucelawson.co.uk">Bruce</a> and <a href="http://www.splintered.co.uk">Patrick</a> go on about something interesting.

I’m giving a talk on using <a href="http://radiantcms.org">Radiant</a> to our local <a href="http://rubyandrails.org/usergroups/newcastle/">Ruby and Rails Usergroup</a> so we’ll see how that goes. I’ll publish the slides afterwards given the chance.

BarCamp London

Yeah. I got a ticket for <a href="http://barcamp.pbwiki.com/BarCampLondon2">Barcamp</a> thanks to <a href="http://blog.meriwilliams.com/">Meri</a>. I just need to think of something to talk about now. Oh, and sort travel.

Future of Web Apps

</td>

20th-21st February

</td>
<td>
Been looking forward to heading down to <a href="http://futureofwebapps.com">FOWA</a> for a while and a few people from <a href="http://thinkco.com">work</a> are coming too. Be good to see all the usual suspects as well, at least those that aren’t going to Barcamp a few days before.

Geek Dinner

21st February

</td>

I’d already booked the day after FOWA off work knowing that something would come up. As if by magic I’m finally in London for one of <a href="http://cubicgarden.com">Ian’s</a> famous <a href="http://www.geekdinner.co.uk/">GeekDinners</a>.

Now I think about it, or rather now I write them all down in one place, I think I might have got carried away.
