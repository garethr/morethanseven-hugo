It turns out the guys at GitHub publish the [commit messages from their work on GitHub](http://github.com/changelog) itself. If you really have to keep up you can even subscribe to an [Atom feed](http://github.com/changelog.atom).

OK, so this might not be hugely useful. But it *is* funny, and a just a nice sign of a small company being open in an interesting way. A few of my favourites:

> mmm pizza... guard against bad SHAs in Walker\#commit

> really need to get a handle on this insane testing setup

> I guess ff3 linux is the worst browser ever made

> dont care
