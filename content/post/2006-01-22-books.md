<p>
I’m something of an avid reader and, making use of the nice <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk">Amazon</a> API I’ll try to keep my reading list up to date on here. I’m just including books that are maybe a little relevant to the web – otherwise this will get out of hand. I’d like to include some brief reviews if the time ever comes along, though dont hold your breath.
