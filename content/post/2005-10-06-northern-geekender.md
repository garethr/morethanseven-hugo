Peter J Lambert of <a href="http://pixelicious.co.uk/">Pixelicious</a> fame has had a great idea. At least the best idea I heard today. Pretty short notice but if anyone fancies a trip down (or up?) to York for something of a geek get together let me know.

I can’t say I’m definately going as I just found out but decided to spread the word anyway – and with any luck will definately try and make the trip. I had been feeling (and I think I even complained once) about the lack of a sense of Northerness (not that southerners, or Scots for that matter, aren’t nice people or anything but…) amongst web design. Real Ale, Grit, Coal, that sort of thing – you just dont see that much web design that looks like it was inspired by that.

Anyway, the 15th (Saturday) looks to be the date of choice. Head over to <a href="http://pixelicious.co.uk/">pixelicious.co.uk</a> to express an interest or complain or find out more information.

If anyone from around Newcastle does fancy it let me know as well – I’d probably be even more inclined to go and meet strangers if other strangers (or <a href="http://randomcat.co.uk">Chris</a>) who live and work near me where going.
