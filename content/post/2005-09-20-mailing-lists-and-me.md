Ok. I just came to a realisation. I think somewhere along the line I got addicted. First I tried one. It seemed pretty good. Not really having any effect on my and generally just being good to feel part of something.

</p>
<p>
But I couldn’t stop at one. I thought I could handle more and more. So I went in for some of the hard stuff. And lots of it.

And look at me now. Typing this while waiting for more email that is reasonable for a small company in a week to download because I didn’t check my email for a day or so. Time for rehab I think.

I dont want to chuck the habit completely, just pair back my addiction, get some control. So who stays and who goes?

DiH (designersinhouse.com) is certainly leading at the moment as a keeper. It’s proved useful, interesting and informative so far – plus I met Matt at @media.

I think maybe their’s room for one more. CSS-d, WSG, thelist, webdesign-L your time is coming.
