Ruby people *really* don't like CSS do they? But [Less](http://lesscss.org/) is actually pretty cool. It's basically an attempt to bootstrap features, specifically Variables, Mixins, Operations and Nested Rules, into CSS. The best part about this is it uses CSS syntax and a simple one step compiler. I'd be interested to know what the folks at the W3C think about this.

So for instance you can do:

pre. /\* LESS \*/
`brand_color: #4D926F;
#header {
  color: `brand\_color;
}
h2 {
color: @brand\_color;
}

and compile it down to:

pre. /\* CSS \*/
\#header {
color: \#4D926F;
}
h2 {
color: \#4D926F;
}
