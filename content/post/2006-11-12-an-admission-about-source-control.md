title: An Admission about Source Control
url: /2006/11/12/an-admission-about-source-control/
---

<p>
I have an admission to make; for personal projects, of which I have many, I haven’t been using source control until now. The reason? Probably laziness. I do lots of reading around the whole software development process but most of that gets used at work, at least until now.

</p>
<p>
One of my favourite articles is the old <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html">Joel Test</a>. Some of this is less relevant to the home developer, but it does give you somewhere to start from. Well, I’ve now got <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">subversion</a> up and running and all new projects will be going in their. I’ve already added the repository to my backup policy. The free book <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">Version Control with Subversion</a> provided all the information I needed to get up and running. I’m more of a fan of command line interfaces anyway so haven’t installed any special interface. I’m sure I’ll look into the <a href="http://www.macromates.com/">Textmate</a> integration once I know my way around the command line interface a bit more.

</p>
<p>
Next up I’m on the lookout for something to use for bug tracking. I already use <a href="http://backpackit.com">backpack</a> and <a href="http://basecamphq.com">basecamp</a> for different activities but I’m not sure yet if they will do for proper bug tracking. I dont really like <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">bugzilla</a>, although maybe <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">trac</a> is what I’m looking for?

</p>
<p>
What does anyone else use, either for source control or bug tracking?
