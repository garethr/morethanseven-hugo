I’ve of late been playing around with a number of different ways of storing bookmarks after realising I was just not bothering before. I added del.icio.us links to the site a bit ago and I’ve just come across Scuttle (<a href="http://scuttle.org">scuttle.org</a>) which is a GPL PHP del.icio.us clone which is really quite nice.

I’ve set it up at the moment on one of my machines and might look to add a styled and modified version to this site as time and inclination allow.
