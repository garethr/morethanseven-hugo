[Stuart](http://muffinresearch.co.uk/) at work has been playing with a nice [Python web crawler](https://edge.launchpad.net/spyder) recently. I've used [Harvestman](http://www.harvestmanontheweb.com/) before but it's not the most straightforward thing to work with. Spyder has a really nifty callback based approach and a couple of hooks which allows you to write code like:

pre. crawler = Spyder()
crawler.register(my\_custom\_method, 'post\_fetch\_html')
crawler.run(URL)

On a side note I wish [Launchpad](http://launchpad.net) was as clean and tidy as [GitHub](http://github.com) though. I can see GitHub adding some of the features that Launchpad has eventually, but I hope they fit them in around the existing features.
