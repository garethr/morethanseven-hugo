Wow. I’m still pretty wired after two days of conference and several late nights but boy was it worth the effort and more.

First I just want to say a big thanks to Patrick (<a href="http://www.htmldog.com">htmldog.com</a>) for organising the event and to all the speakers and attendees I spoke to.

</p>
<p>
I must mention Molly Holzschlag (<a href="http://www.molly.com">www.molly.com</a>) individually for being amazing thought. Thanks for the beer.

I’ll hopefully get something more useful up here with more salient points over the next couple of weeks but for the moment I just want to say it was an inspirational couple of days, and make sure to watch the blogs of the speakers for real indepth stuff (rather than just awe).
