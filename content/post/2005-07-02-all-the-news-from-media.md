After a little work I’ve put together an app to keep up to date with all the news around `media. Based on the collection of feeds from <a href="http://kurafire.net">kurafire.net</a> it collects and filters for posts for `media references and displays them.

</p>
<p>
I’m hoping it will proove useful to anyone else who wants to keep up to date. Especially when details start coming up about next year and in the lead up to that.

</p>
<p>
Have a look at <a href="http://morethanseven.net/atmedia">morethanseven.net/atmedia</a>. If you have any more feeds just let me know – I want it to be as extensive as possible.
