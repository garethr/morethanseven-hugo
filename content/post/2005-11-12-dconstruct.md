Right. I wasn’t at <a href="http://www.dconstruct.org">d.Construct</a> I’m still a bit gutted really as it sounded like a hoot and lots of it was up my street and would have been good to meet up with ‘people’. But hey, I can still watch the feeds pour in right?

</p>
<p>
With that in mind, to again make my life easier and hopefully be of some use I’ve set up another (the first one was for <a href="http://www.atmedia2005.co.uk">@media</a>) feed syndicator.

</p>
<p>
<a href="http://morethanseven.net/dconstruct">morethanseven.net/dconstruct</a>

</p>

All I’m doing is parsing, storing and displaying all the feeds. On first run I picked up 27 and hopefully by the time you read this more will have been said. The collection of feeds are a combination of people I’ve met and people who where blogging about `media. If you have a feed and want it adding just leave a comment on here or drop me an <a href="mailto:gareth`morethanseven.net"&gt;email</a> and I’ll add it to the rest.

</p>

I’ll just say a big shout for everyone at <a href="http://www.clearleft.com">Clearleft</a> for organising it on such short notice. I’d rather thinks like this happen and me not be there than they not happen at all because of problems with size or cost or admin. Maybe next year?
