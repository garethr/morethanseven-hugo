<p>
Not so subtle hint in the subject line, but without further ado, Molly (yes, that <a href="http://molly.com">Molly</a>) is coming to Newcastle for a talk.

</p>
<p>
All the details are still being confirmed but we are talking:

</p>
<p>
<strong>15th February</strong>
Room 149 Northumberland Building, Northumbria University, City Campus, Newcastle, NE1 8ST
<strong>5-7pm</strong>

</p>
<p>
After talk drinks and food to be confirmed. Probably going to be along the lines of “Webstandards and Usability” with some time for a Q&A session as well.

</p>
<p>
Big up to <a href="http://tomsimcox.com">Tom Simcox</a> here. He’s been threatening for a while and with Molly in the country she’s agreed to come and visit little old us. Mark (of sunderland uni and NEUA fame) also sorted out the venue, amongst other things. Good job everyone.

</p>
<p>
We need people along for this so tell you employers, whoop to your colleagues, threaten you employees and be there.

</p>
<p>
I’ll post more details as they are confirmed. If your from outside the region and want to come along let me know. It’s short notice but sometimes these things are – and you know you dont want to miss out.

</p>
<p>
To help us gauge interest a little it would be grate if you interested to leave a comment below. If you cant come along because say, <a href="http://xlab.co.uk">it’s your birthday</a>, then what questions would you like asking?
