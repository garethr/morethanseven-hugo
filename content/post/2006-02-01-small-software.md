Of late I’ve found myself making quite a few smaller purchases of software. I’ve always been a fan of Open Source (and before that shareware – mainly on the ZX Spectrum) and still use lots of open source apps (anyone say Firefox) but for some really specific jobs it’s nice to have something you know is maybe a little more polished.

</p>
<p>
I dont know if it’s just me getting older and having more disposable income, or a greater appreciation of what it takes to make really good software (probably a bit of both) but it’s sort of snuck up on me? Anyone else finding the same? I know <a href="http://hicksdesign.co.uk">Jon</a> has been mentioning some <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/happy-old-man">cool new apps</a> he’s using. What about everyone else?

</p>
<p>
Recent purchase have included the following, nearly all bought with <a href="http://paypal.com">PayPal</a> as it happens:

</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/">Airfoil</a> allows any sounds (mainly music) to be send round the house to speakers connected to my AirPort. Lovely.

</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.nullriver.com/index/products/pspware">PSPWare</a> Like iSync but for my PSP. Also converts movies.

</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/radioshark/">radioShark</a> Ok, software and hardware but useful at times.

</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.haveamint.com">Mint</a> I’ve mentioned before. Lovely stats.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
I’m also evaluating (and at the moment being impressed by) a few other apps. Upcoming purchases probably.

</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://standalone.com/palmos/quick_news/">QuickNews</a> RSS reader (and podcasting app) for Palm OS.

</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.pocket-tunes.com/">PocketTunes</a> Good quality audio player for Palm OS, much better than the bundled Real Audio.

</li>
<li>
<a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> The missing editor for OS X? Maybe. It’s toying with me at the moment to sit aside <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">SubEthaEdit</a>

</li>
</ul>
<p>
On a blog related point, I’m aware I’ve been blogging more technology related stuff of late. I’ll be back with alot more web design and development banter soon, and some things happening up this neck of the woods (including a revamped <a href="http://newcastlenewmedia.org">newcastlenewmedia</a> site hopefully) – it’s a matter of having the ideas but not having the time! Hope it’s still all interesting to everyone.
