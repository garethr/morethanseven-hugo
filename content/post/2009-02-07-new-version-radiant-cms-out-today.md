title: New Version of Radiant CMS Out Today

---

Via [tagging a new release](http://github.com/radiant/radiant/tree/master) on GitHub I see a new version of [Radiant](http://radiantcms.org/) (0.7) has been released. Radiant is a really nice CMS for smaller projects, it's used on the official [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) site and I used it here at one point.

Go check out the [blog post for the full list of the changes](http://radiantcms.org/blog/archives/2009/02/07/radiant-0-7-0---intaglio-release-final/).
