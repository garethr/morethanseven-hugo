I’m something of a want to be foodie. I’ve been a fan of food since working in a <a href="http://www.bentleys-foodandwine.co.uk/">restaurant</a> as a KP way back when I was at school. I like staying in and cooking, watching the odd food related progamme and going out to nice restaurants. However, I suddently realised it’s one of those things I dont yet do online. Most of the other things I do, or am interested in, I do at least in part online – except food.

</p>
<p>
So I set out to see what I could find. I’d <a href="http://corkd.com/people/garethr/cellar">signed up</a> for <a href="http://corkd.com/">Cork’d</a> a while back after the buzz around the site in the web standards and Rails community. I’ve added a few wines and a few drinking buddies and keep thinking I should keep it up to date but…

</p>
<p>
A quick search threw up <a href="http://chugd.com/">Chug’d</a>, <a href="http://www.menuism.com/">Menuism</a> and <a href="http://www.recipematcher.com/">Recipe matcher</a> to name but a few – all complete with Web 2.0 cliches. But nothing that really made me want to sign up. I’m not looking for a food community really, more a useful tool to store food related tit bits. Recipes. Which wine goes with what and when the best time to get perculier beers might be. Like a food focused version of <a href="http://backpackit.com">backpack</a> maybe? A mobile interface, hey maybe even a Palm based data entry setup would top things off nicely.

</p>
<p>
Any other food people reading with a workflow that works? We’re always talking about software workflow or <a href="http://www.davidco.com/what_is_gtd.php">getting things done</a> but what about something important like food!
