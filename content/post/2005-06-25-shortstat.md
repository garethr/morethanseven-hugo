I’ve just install the ShortStat package from <a href="http://www.shauninman.com">www.shauninman.com</a> and the Mac OS X widget from <a href="http://www.keeganjones.com/widgets/shortstat/">www.keeganjones.com/widgets/shortstat/</a> to go along with it. My desktop now tells me how few people are visiting my site!

</p>
<p>
It’s the first really useful widget I can see myself using for more than pure eye candy.

</p>
<p>
And ShortStat itself seems to be a very nice addition. Simple to set up and the output is nice and clear.

To both the people visiting the site – dont worry I wont use your browsing habits for anything other than improving the site!
