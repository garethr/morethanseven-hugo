I've just found [Dreque](http://github.com/samuel/dreque) from [Samuel Stauffer](http://samuelks.com/) on GitHub. It's yet another take on the whole messaging things which is definitely seeing a lot of activity at the back end of this year. It's using [Redis](http://code.google.com/p/redis/) on the backend and looks really rather nice:

Submitting jobs:

    <code>from dreque import Dreque
    def some_job(argument):
        pass
    dreque = Dreque("127.0.0.1")
    dreque.enqueue("queue", some_job, argument="foo")</code>

Worker:

    <code>from dreque import DrequeWorker
    worker = DrequeWorker(["queue"], "127.0.0.1")
    worker.work()</code>
