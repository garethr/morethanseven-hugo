All of a sudden it’s all about the real world. In fact that’s my prediction for 2006 – geeks moving out into real social activities (often involving beer) around blogs and mailing lists what not. Anyway…

After the Northern Geekender yesterday, which was a really good do for all those that couldn’t make it, I found out about another meet up even closer to home – in Newcastle no less.

So people over at the <a href="http://www.accessify.com">Accessify</a> forum are organising a <a href="http://www.accessifyforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=28544#28544">get together</a> on the 27th of this month. Things are coming fast and furious at the moment. I’ll hopefully be going along, although it starts at 5:30 and I finish work at 6:00 so might be a bit late.

I’ll post more details about that as I get anything, and I’ll post any half decent photos (and link to the inevitable <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a> group) as stuff happens.
