Yes it’s back. <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2006">@media</a> returns as promised by <a href="http://htmldog.com">Patrick</a> last year and, well, it’s definately bigger. Two streams, more speakers and panels than you can shake a pink elephant at. I know for a fact that this was being planned even before <a href="http://molly.com">Molly</a> had left the bar last year and boy does it show.

The blogs are alight with the sound of people coming up with something, anything to tell their bosses in the morning. I’m sure I’m not the only one still awake either posting comments (Yes <a href="http://zachinglis.com">Zach</a>, <a href="http://spintered.co.uk">Patrick</a> I do mean you) and making blog posts.

I’ll post more about what I want to see, how I’m going to decide which sessions to go to (I’ll need some sort of system – simply trying to decide which one’s will be best will only end in heartbreak) over the next 6 months or so. Yes it really is that far away. With the <a href="http://www.carsonworkshops.com/summit">Carson Summit</a> coming up so soon as well that should more than keep me going – especially with them having different emphasise (web standards/accessibility and web application development/design respectively) to keep thinks from getting boring.

</p>
<p>
And with all that in mind the reason it’s late when I post this makes sense. Yes it’s <a href="http://morethanseven.net/atmedia">another</a> <a href="http://morethanseven.net/dconstruct">feed</a> <a href="http://morethanseven.net/carson">agregator</a> thing.

The place is already starting to hot up and I’d guess that will only get worse (or better?) over the next few days. I’m glad to get in early this time. Last year proved useful (at least to me) in keeping up with the aftershow goings on with 150 posts from 52 feeds – but I only got it together a week or so after the event, thanks mainly to <a href="http://kurafire.net">Faruk</a> for compiling the initial list of posts.

</p>
<p>
Any bugs or suggestions let me know. Also if anyone has a good name (feed agregator is pretty mechanical) then please do tell. I’ve added a few of the requested features from previous editions and it’s now possible to quickly suggest new feeds and to search through all the posts.

</p>
<p>
Anyway – Hope to see people in June. My predictions of a year of real world activity to mirror our enlightened online existence are coming to fruitition already.
